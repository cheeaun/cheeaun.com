Physics paper 2
===

I'm speechless. I managed to do the first few structure questions, covering chapters such as  Gravitation, Deformation of Solids, Magnetic Fields, and Capacitors. The essay part is **much harder**. I remember that one of the essay questions is a clone of a question in STPM 2002, the one stating to write down the lens maker's formula, under the chapter of Geometrical Optics. The bad news is that I forgot the formula. Ouch.
