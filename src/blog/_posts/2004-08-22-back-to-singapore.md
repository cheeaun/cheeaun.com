Back to Singapore
===

My sister flew back to Singapore today. She'll be back again next year during Chinese New Year. For the past 4 days, she toured around Penang, went to my aunt's house, and had fun with her friends. She also used my computer to surf the Internet, just checking emails. I found out that my sister is not quite computer-literate because the only web browser she recognise is Internet Explorer. She checked her Hotmail and Yahoo! accounts, and sometimes browsed around Friendster because someone has added her as a friend. The first day she logs on, she couldn't access her accounts because I've disabled Javascript in the Internet Explorer settings. I re-enabled it and let her use Internet Explorer. I supposed Mozila Firefox sounds too geeky for her.

And by the way, happy birthday to my classmate, Chiew Wern Yih!
