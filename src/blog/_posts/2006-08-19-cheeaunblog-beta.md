![a 'cheeaunblog beta' web 2.0 logo, rendered with vibrant colours and reflection effects](/blog/images/artwork/logos/cheeaunblog_beta_logo_reflection_web_2.0.png)

It seems that many people, even Neil, are [playing with it](http://neilturner.me.uk/2006/Aug/18/neilturnr_20_beta.html "neilturnr 2.0 beta!"). I just couldn't resist. Haha.

The logo is generated by the [Web 2.0 Logo Generator](http://msig.info/web2.php). For those scratching their heads, it's not too late to learn about [Web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2). And it's cool.
