Webmaster Gathering @ KL
===

First, it's been a **very, very long time** that I haven't attend any *public* gathering. I used to join blogger gatherings in Penang, but due to my busy university life, I can't do much. But fortunately, I got the chance to attend the [webmaster gathering](http://www.webmastermalaysia.com/news-announcements/11534-webmaster-gathering-17th-november-starbucks-kl-sentral.html "Webmaster Gathering 17th November @ Starbucks, KL Sentral") today at Starbucks, KL Sentral. Yeah, lucky me.

The gathering is pretty cool. I saw LiewCF of [LiewCF.com](http://liewcf.com/). And a few people from [Exabytes](http://www.exabytes.com.my/). And also some cool people like Safirul Alredha of [Zeo](http://zeo.unic.net.my/) and MENJ of [Critical Thoughts](http://www.menj.org/). I guess the coolest part is to meet Hanson Toh, who is the **Google Country Consultant in Malaysia!** Totally awesome. Especially the Google goodies that I've *stolen* there. Haha.

There were few presentations on Google stuff, [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) and some ways to make money online. It was quite okay, though I was actually expecting some presentations on Javascript libraries, PHP frameworks, CSS techniques or [Adobe AIR](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/). Maybe next time then?

Maybe.
