Pertiena Banquet
===

The Pertiena banquet was quite a blast. The Lower Six students organised it for us Upper Six at the Penang Golf Resort. Firdaus took me there on his bike at 7.30PM. Quite a number of my friends arrived there early, including teachers. We ate, laughed, played games, and had fun. The teachers also presented certificates to active members of Pertiena. I received two certificates for being a committee member and facilitator of the Pertiena orientation. At that time, we also celebrated birthdays of Firdaus and Kalidevi. Such coincidence.

The banquet finally ended at 11. Suba gave me a lift back home, including Joanne and Jonathan. I just felt so tired. I also have to sleep quickly because tomorrow, I have a seminar to attend.
