My Life in 2013
===

2013 has been a rather slow but progressive year for me. It's that time of the year again so, here goes:

- On February, I built [my own tweets archive site](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/305642015587184641), just few months after [Twitter Archive is announced](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/your-twitter-archive). It uses [CouchDB](https://github.com/cheeaun/tweet-couch) to store the tweets and it's hosted on [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/).

- Around mid-year, I [moved on](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/349709680236433408) and took the [next step in my career journey](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/351666861085179905).

- I tried to embark on a (public) contribution streak on GitHub, only managed to do it for 33 days, from 8 August to 9 September. A little tiring but I think it's a pretty interesting experiment.

- [KopiJS](https://github.com/KopiJS/kopi.js) was born, perhaps [out of boredom](https://twitter.com/laktek/status/400080522656759808). It's a collaboration work by [@laktek](http://twitter.com/laktek), [@chuyeow](http://twitter.com/chuyeow), [@soulofpeace](http://twitter.com/soulofpeace) and myself, with contributions by many others, to create a library and a test specification for Singaporean coffee. It became sort of trending and we had [two](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/406427812682158081) [meetups](https://github.com/KopiJS/kopi.js/issues/2) with a very [good turnout](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/411153613310808064)!

- On 21 December, I finally release the [iOS 7 theme](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/414423892707401728) for [HackerWeb](http://hackerwebapp.com/). It took me quite some time and I'm glad that the feedback has been [good](https://twitter.com/cityzenllc/status/414445380953440257) [so](https://twitter.com/billjive/status/414498642561486849) [far](https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/414543591160049665).

- Perhaps the biggest news for me this year would be the [launch of Life](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/405336543188893696) and it was [featured on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6833565). I was really surprised at the reception as the GitHub repository got over [a thousand stars and 200 forks](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/407870423808761856) in just one day!

- For some reason, my most favorite emoticon this year is the ['Look of Disapproval'](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/%E0%B2%A0_%E0%B2%A0-look-of-disapproval). I've been consistently using it for cases when I read weird code or text copy, and looking back at this emoticon magically makes me feel better. ಠ_ಠ

That's all for 2013. And a big hello to 2014!
