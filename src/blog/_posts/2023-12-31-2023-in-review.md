## Extended unemployment

I was expecting at most 1-year of unemployment before I get bored and wanting to start work again.

But somehow I don't feel like working yet. Feels like a gut feeling thing or I'm still feeling fatigued. There's a sense of guilt building up but I decided to just do what I want and not get pressured or stressed by it.

Roughly one year after my unemployment, [tech layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/) were *still* happening, so it doesn't feel like things are going to be smooth-sailing yet. It's quite and not quite post-pandemic at the same time, as most folks are still working from home on some days of the week as part of the "new normal" working arrangements. Not a lot of tech meetups too, compared to pre-pandemic days.

## Projects

I should say, just one project, not project*s*.

I've spent the whole year working on [Phanpy](https://github.com/cheeaun/phanpy), a 3rd-party web client for [Mastodon-compatible social networks](https://joinmastodon.org/). It's been surprisingly enjoyable and challenging, as I use *all* my front-end chops, design skills, usability knowledge and years of experience on creating my *ideal* social media client.

I've added so many cool features since the first inception [last December](https://mastodon.social/@cheeaun/109515757404630583).

- **Thread count indicator** – automatic marking of "1/X" on threaded posts so that authors don't have to type it themselves.
- **Boosts Carousel** – group all reposted posts from the timeline into separate horizontal-scrolling carousels to prevent them from hogging the timeline.
- **Multi-column mode** – Tweetdeck-like UI for multiple configurable columns of timelines.
- **Post translation** – full-fledged translation UI with auto-detection of source text, configurable source language and even includes pronunciation text.
- **(Non-native) Quote posts** – links to other Mastodon/Fediverse posts will be expanded to look like quote posts.
- **Web Push notifications** – push notifications on the web, a feature that's more widely available now since [the release of iOS 16.4](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/).
- **Profile posting stats** – quick visualisation of an account's posting habits showing percentage of original posts, reposts and replies within the last specific number of days.
- **"ALT" badge & inline captions** – Instead of just showing ALT badges, they're also conditionally inlined like image captions.
- **Experimental image description generator** – using [GPT-4 with Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) to [generate description for images](https://mastodon.social/@cheeaun/111647227648224117) when posting images.
- And… a whole bunch of small UI tweaks and bug fixes.

I'm quite proud of this. It's pretty hard to explain or describe in words, thus I feel that folks should really try the web app to "get it".

I find myself surprised that I'm able to focus on *one* project as I usually get distracted easily to start another new project or shift focus to one of my existing projects.

It feels good to focus on building a product, *not* during your "free time" or after-work hours, and really just laser-focus on delivering the best user experience without tight deadlines, the need to chase numbers, or reach certain KPI's.

Thanks to Phanpy, my sponsorship grew quite significantly on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cheeaun) and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/cheeaun). I really appreciate all the donations! 🙇‍♂️.

## Looking back

![View from Sky Garden Capitaspring, looking at Singapore River, Asian Civilizations Museum and Swissôtel The Stamford](../images/photos/scenery/view-sky-garden-capitaspring-singapore-river-asian-civilizations-museum-swissotel-the-stamford.jpg)

Despite having more than a year to think about my next steps, I didn't really put much thought in the end. After 1.5 years of unemployment, I started to get used to this, which is something that I never thought that I could. Time passed by so fast while everyone else continue working, meeting friends, and travelling.

I'm grateful that I have the luxury to be jobless for this long. I'm still able to spend on things that I want. I could go to places like art museums during weekdays while everyone else is working.

There's still a lot of things in my mind. A lot of to-dos and future planning.

But, I'm just too lazy to think.

And I want to convince myself that it's fine to be lazy.
