Firefox 0.9 installation

I've uninstalled Mozilla Firefox 0.9RC and 0.8 from my Windows XP system. I've  deleted the Firefox folder from the profiles directory, just to make sure everything starts out clean. I've double-clicked the 'FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe' file, imported my previous Firefox 0.8 settings (history, cookies, saved passwords and bookmarks) and installed it successfully. I've also installed three themes, [Qute 2.1.1](http://quadrone.org/projects/mozilla/browser/), [Doodle (Classic) 1.5.3](http://home.student.uu.se/dana3949/doodle/) and [Lure 0.4.3](http://digiboy.deviantart.com/), downloaded from [Mozilla Update](http://update.mozilla.org/). Firefox's theme-switching feature has improved to be much better and faster this time. Everything seems so smooth and simple. I think it's time for me to start doing some updating work for my Phoenity theme. I have to update it quick, not to upset the Phoenity fans, whoever.
