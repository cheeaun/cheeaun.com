Winstripe changes and Gmail stuff
===

Early morning I got online and found out that [MozillaZine forum](http://forums.mozillazine.org/) is down. Something must have happened. And I don't even know why. Maybe due to the recent changes in the Winstripe theme? Has it [improved](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/005845.html "Winstripe Improved")? Is it [better compared to previous Firefox themes](http://home.hccnet.nl/e.vd.beek/blog/2004/06/091.html "0.9.1")? It [looks more Windows-like](http://neilturner.me.uk/2004/Jun/25/firefox_091_screenshots.html "Firefox 0.9.1 Screenshots")? I think so. Looking at the screenshots, I'm scratching my head. *Only five toolbar icons are changed?* I didn't actually download the nightlies to check out the icons, but I know that the Mozilla Visual Identity Team *did* consider my opinions, such as the use of arrows for the Back or Forward icons, the right-angle rotation of the Reload icon and the three-dimensional look of the Home icon. Good, but I won't comment further till Firefox 0.9.1 released.

By the way, I just found two neat stuff for Gmail users. First, [GMailCompose](http://livejournal.com/users/jedbro/16565.html "Gmail Compose & BBCode"), an extension for Firefox 0.9 and later, which works almost like [G-Mailto](http://rabidsquirrel.net/G-Mailto/) but *better*. Second, [some very useful tips](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_06_26_index.html#108825308795611349 "Gmail Tips") to play with your Gmail address or *addresses*. Cool.
