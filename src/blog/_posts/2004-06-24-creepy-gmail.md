Creepy Gmail

Searching for the [term 'Gmail' on Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=gmail) is a *bad* idea. It just [creeps me out](http://gmail-is-too-creepy.com/ "Gmail is too creepy"). I've found out that [Gtray](http://torrez.us/archives/2004/05/23/000272.html "Gmail and GTray") is pretty useful, but unfortunately it doesn't work with Firefox. [G-Mailto](http://rabidsquirrel.net/G-Mailto/) looks interesting, but it overrides the default action of mailto: links. This 1 Gb email service has been good for me. I've sent a suggestion to the Gmail team, regarding the cluttered interface of Gmail's email listing. I supposed one of the most serious bug in Gmail is its [inaccessibility](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/10/gmail-accessibility "Gmail Accessibility") and *heavy* dependency on Javascript. After a week of using Gmail, now I get six invitations for giveaway. At first, I thought that these invitations are only available for *active* users based on their usage statistics. Actually, there is [no secret behind it](http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/06/21/the_secret_behind_getting_more_gmail_invites.php "The secret behind getting more Gmail invites") because the invitations are given *randomly*. I got Gmail because I'm invited by Asa Dotzler. I'm surprised to see that even the Google/Blogger guys  invite me. I just had a look at the [Blogger Dashboard](http://blogger.com/home) and found a small Gmail invitation section on the right sidebar of the web page. As an active Blogger user, would I like to give it a whirl? No, thanks. I already have an account, and it's enough. Now, I'm looking forward to send invitations to my friends. If I have few invitations left, I might start a Gmail giveaway contest. So, stay tuned.
