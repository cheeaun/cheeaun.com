My **22<sup>nd</sup> birthday**. Wow. Time is fast.

My new semester has begun since last 3 weeks. Been quite busy since then. I'm now a Third Year student. My subjects now are Digital Signal Processing Systems. Embedded Systems Design, Computer Vision and Imaging, and Advanced Computer Networks. Sounds cool.

And oh ya, I've been working on a new project these days. Stay tuned.
