Kopi.JS in 2015
===

I personally find it amazing that [Kopi.JS](http://kopijs.org/) got started in 2013 and next year is going to be 2016. Even the [last article I wrote](/blog/2015/02/the-kopijs-meetup-story) was in February *this* year but somehow feels like a *long* time.

I would like to look back and see how we progress so far, one meetup at a time and one photo at a time.

There‚Äôs a total of [**11 Kopi.JS meetups**](https://github.com/kopijs/kopi.js/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aevent+created%3A2015-01-01..2015-12-31) this year so here goes:

Tiny milestones

Yeap, for newcomers, first of many #kopijs meetups to come. And that includes next year. As always, I would like to thank **everyone** for joining the Kopi.JS meetups and take all these nice and memorable photos.

Happy 2016 to all Kopi (and non-Kopi) lovers üéâ
