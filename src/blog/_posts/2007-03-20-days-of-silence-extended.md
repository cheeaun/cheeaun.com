Days of silence, extended
===

It's quite surprising that my intention to [update my blog](http://www.43things.com/things/view/2745 "keep my blog updated") has been delayed for weeks ever since I got back from Penang last month. Sometimes, I feel like want to update my blog but later become lazy to type.

Okay, time for updates:

- There's one thing I forgot to mention before I went back Penang for Chinese New Year. It's my new MP3 player, the [Creative Zen V Plus](http://www.creative.com/products/mp3/zenv/). It costs around RM 400, contains 2Gb of memory space and looks great. I was a little disappointed that I bought this instead of the expensive [iPod nano](http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/). But last week, I saw my course mate bought iPod nano and found that it's not really *that* good after all, except that it's just, you know, **cool**. Haha!

- Also, adding to my excitement, I finally got myself a new mobile phone! It's [Nokia 5300 XpressMusic](http://www.nokia-asia.com/5300xpressmusic/). As expected, it looks really beautiful and the sound is awesome. I'm so glad that I got rid of my old [Nokia 3100](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3100).

That's all. Most are related to gadgets.
