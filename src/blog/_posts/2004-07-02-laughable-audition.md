Laughable audition
===

I watched Malaysian Idol again, and the fourth audition in Kuala Lumpur was great. There were some contestants who just don't give up and try again and again. There were some who hate the judges for being *too frank* commenting on their good-but-not-good-enough performances. I'm surprised that few mobility impaired people took part in the audition. I'm even more surprised to see some contestants *overwhelmed* the judges with their silly hand gestures, odd voices and assorted tricks. The audition was *sort of* laughable. Very, very laughable.
