Red eye
===

Last two days, my right eye was red. Today, my left eye is red, instead. No, it's **not** a disease, but more like a *bacterial infection*. Why I'm so sure? Because my eyes are sometimes itchy and I rub them with my bare hands. Silly me. My friends always get distracted by the redness of my eye whenever they talked to me, face to face. They keep asking me about my bloodshot eye. So, I thought, is there *any* reason for this? Beats me. Once in a few minutes, I go to the toilet to wash my eyes. I supposed it's just a minor problem. Really, I don't understand why I'm blogging about this anyway. Please pardon me, okay?
