New year
===

It's the year 2005, and I hope it will be a great year for everyone. I realised that I've been blogging for the past 6 months and I'm getting more addicted to it. Well, I found one blog worth mentioning here, the [Penang Tsunami](http://tsunamipenang.blogspot.com/ "Tsunami Disaster in Malaysia and Thailand") weblog. It's a blog by Penangites covering news and updates of the earthquake and tsunami tragedy. Keep up the work, guys.

By the way, it seems that there are *unusually strong winds* blowing around my area. Is it related to tsunami?
