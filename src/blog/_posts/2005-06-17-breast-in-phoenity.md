This is really one of the [funniest user comments](https://addons.mozilla.org/themes/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=5&page=comments "Phoenity - User Comments") I've ever read. Who would have thought of that? This comment is posted on my theme's comments page on [Mozilla Update](https://addons.mozilla.org/) by a creative fellow named polly on 30 April 2005. Of course, I would highly appreciate his *or her* sense of humour which proves that things you see always depends on your own perspective.

So, let's have a closer look at Phoenity's *motion indicator*, also known as the throbber widget. It is an animated GIF file, which renders a rounded-corner rectangle with a radial gradient of bright blue. The animation features 16 frames, each displayed every 0.03 seconds. Those who never use my theme before should try to imagine the bright area *swirling* in the blue rectangle. Those who use my theme on Firefox, go load any page, and stare at it long enough.
