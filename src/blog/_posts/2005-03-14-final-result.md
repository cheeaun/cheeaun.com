The final result
===

I got B for <span lang="ms" title="General Studies">Pengajian Am</span>, B- for Mathematics, C- for Physics and C for Chemistry. Most of my friends got quite familiar results. Some scored at least an A, while others straight B's. Only three friends I know got straight A's, including Will Sen. Before posting this, I hesitate. Two years of studying in Form 6 and this is the outcome. Neither good nor bad. I guess most people might be surprised that I'm **not** a straight-A scorer.

Now, I'm going to bury my head into the ground and hibernate my brain for a while. Please excuse me.
