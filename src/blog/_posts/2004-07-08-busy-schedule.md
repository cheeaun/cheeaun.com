Busy schedule
===

Why do I get more busy than ever? I have more work at school and more projects to be done. I still have the Phoenity theme lying on my hard disk, untouched since last two days. By the time I get online, I was surprised by the [Bloglines redesign](http://bloglines.com/about/news#63 "New User Interface and Clip Blogs"), which [looks much better and friendlier](http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/07/08/bloglines_gets_much_cooler.php "Bloglines gets much cooler") than before. Checking the MozillaZine forums, I read about the ambitious [Firefox 1.0 plan](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=94779 "1.0 Release Plan") and [community marketing project](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=96004 "1000 reviews. 7 days.") by Ben Goodger. Thinking of [Firefox 1.0](http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/roadmap.html "Firefox 1.0 Roadmap"), I start to [reminisce about the past](http://theseblog.free.fr/2004/07/phoenixmozilla-firebirdfirefox-seen.html "Phoenix/Mozilla Firebird/Firefox seen through 9 releases "). At present, there are few things to note such as the [implementation of the new Find toolbar](http://squarefree.com/burningedge/archives/000494.html "Find Toolbar"), Asa's [question about the font used](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/005917.html "firefox fonts?") in [Firefox buttons](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/buttons.html) and possibly [upcoming Firefox 0.9.2](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=95932 "Firefox 0.9.2 Coming?"). Whoa, I need to speed up my pace.
