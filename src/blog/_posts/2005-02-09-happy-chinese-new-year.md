Happy Chinese New Year
===

For the past two days, I didn't go to work. I was sick. By around 2am in the morning, I suddenly felt nauseous. I've vomited quite a lot of *junk* out of my stomach for about 2 hours. Then I went back to sleep again. I thought I would be okay after vomiting. At 6, I woke up again, *still* feeling nauseous. I vomited but nothing came out, because my stomach was *empty*. I went to see the doctor and she said I got **food poisoning**. She prescribed some medicine and immediately I ate the pills after came back home. I didn't vomit anymore. Good.

On the second day, Chinese New Year's eve, I took my medicine as usual. Suddenly, I felt some *numbness* on my neck, shoulder and waist. My neck kept bending to one side, as my muscles tighten behind my shoulder. This really **freaked me out** because I was no different that those **physically paralysed people**! The more I try to fight back, the more pain I felt in my muscles. It was terrible. I couldn't even stand straight.

My parents were very worried and sent me to the Bagan Specialist Centre. I was warded for one night. Few doctors took a look at my condition, some told my dad that I am allergic to [Stemetil](http://drugs.com/cons/Stemetil.html "Stemetil Drug Information"). Let me repeat, I am **allergic to Stemetil!** Because of this *medication*, it causes some *scary* side effect in my body system. Very, very scary.

So, I've spent my Chinese New Year's eve on the bed, listening to the fireworks happening outside. Fortunately, I was accompanied by few other patients in the room. I don't mean to offend anyone, but really, all of them have *amazing snoring capabilities*. I woke up this morning and got ready to check out. I found out that my muscles ache, due to the side effect. So uncomfortable. Anyway, don't worry, I'll fully recover soon.

Here I wish everyone a **Happy Chinese New Year**!
