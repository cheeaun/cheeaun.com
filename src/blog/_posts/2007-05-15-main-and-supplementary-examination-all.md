Main and supplementary examination, all done
===

Just yesterday, I've done my *supplementary paper* for Economics, because I got 'D' for it. How unlucky. I've actually finish my main examination since 7 May. Gosh, I really have no idea why a Computer Engineering student need to take Economics. It's an elective subject. Some of my course mates got to choose the Management Principle subject because it's obviously *easier*, while I'm stuck to this Economics subject.

Anyway, it's already over. And I won't be back hometown this time. Staying here in Petaling Jaya and find something to do. Haha.
