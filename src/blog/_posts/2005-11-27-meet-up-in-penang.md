Meet up in Penang
===

Okay, I just went to a meet up this evening, riding on Yvy's [*cozy* car](http://mistyeiz.com/ "Yvy's Cozy Corner"). We reached the Ice Ice Baby Restaurant just about time to have lunch, with Lucia, n305er from [n305er.com](http://n305er.com/blog/ "n305er Industries") and Christopher from [PenangLive.com](http://penanglive.com/ "PenangLive.ComUnity"). Later, Jeremy, so-called [ejrs](http://ejrs.com/) and cmos, the [Blur Sotong](http://cmos.textmalaysia.com/ "Memoirs of a Blur Sotong") guy [joined us](http://n305er.com/blog/?p=383 "Bloggers' and Net Friends' Meet"). Then [came along](http://chanlilian.net/?p=929 "Penang Meet") Aunt Lilian, [grandfather-status](http://put3put4.blogspot.com/ "Put3Put4 Blog-Corner") put3put4, Liew and his *pretty* friends. Kind of cool there. Their amazing cameras **almost blinded my eyes!**

Next time, I'll have to wear sunglasses. Haha.

Also thanks to cmos for giving me a ride to the jetty!
