Sweaty school day
===

The school reopens today, after two weeks of holiday since beginning of the month. This holiday had been *normal* for me, wasting most of my time in front of the monitor and surf some sites once in a while. Anyway, it's been hard to wake up this morning. I was sweaty all over, due to hot Malaysian weather, amplified by global warming phenomenon. Arriving school at about 7, I saw my friends talking about Euro 2004. Who scored? France? Football, again. I wonder if I'm the only guy in this world who doesn't have any interest in football. I also wonder if most computer geeks like such sport. The morning assembly was dull. I got my mid-year test papers from my teachers. They have marked all the papers with their red pens throughout the holiday. Arrgh, I don't think I like those 'X' marks on my papers. Those made me switched to *bad mood* mode. Fortunately, the weather slowly recovered and became clear enough to brighten up my day. At least, I don't feel much sweaty.
