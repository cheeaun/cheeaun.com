Firefox Secrets
===

Cheah Chu Yeow is the man! Though he hasn't been [blogging much](http://blog.codefront.net/ "redemption in a blog") last few months, but he's sure capable to produce such [wonderful book](http://sitepoint.com/books/firefox1/ "Firefox Secrets") for everyone. Also not forgetting Asa Dotzler for being the Expert Reviewer of the book, while still able to spend a little time to [blog](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/ "firefox, cats, mars, and more").

!['Firefox Secrets' book and bonus CD-ROM, authored by Cheah Chu Yeow, published by SitePoint](/blog/images/photos/objects/firefox_secrets_book_cd_rom_sitepoint.jpg)

Just today, I received my **free copy** of the book Firefox Secrets, with **bonus CD-ROM** inside! **Cool!** Well, I'm not the only person who got it. Bernie Zimmermann, author of [GrayModern theme](http://bernzilla.com/projects.php), [received one too](http://bernzilla.com/item.php?id=507 "Firefox Secrets"), much earlier because the place I live is further than his, I guess. Last April, Simon Mackie, the Managing Editor of [SitePoint](http://sitepoint.com/), sent an email to get my permission to include Phoenity on the CD. I agreed and now I got the book in exchange of it.

The book is quite handy, with bright orange and dark blue colours on the cover. I skimmed through and found my theme is introduced on **page 110** under chapter 4, 'Dressing up Firefox'. A screenshot of Phoenity theme is also displayed on the next page, along with Arvid Axelsson's [Qute](http://quadrone.org/). I'm relieved that 'Phoenity' is spelled correctly because I always spot some people misspelled it as 'pheonity' or 'phoenicity'. Haha. Surprisingly, the term 'Phoenity' is also mentioned in the last 'Index' section of the book!

The CD includes two applications, Firefox 1.03 and Thunderbird 1.02. Both are older versions though. It contains few interesting themes and extensions which are featured in the book. Phoenity version 1.5.1 is included as well. I really admire Chu Yeow's skill for writing such detailed yet friendly guide, complete with clear screenshots, examples and explanations. Highly recommended, indeed.

Firefox Secrets costs $29.95 US from [O'reilly](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0975240242/ "Online Catalog: Firefox Secrets, First Edition"). And I'm not sure if this book has arrived our Malaysian book stores. So, am I the **first Malaysian** to have it?
