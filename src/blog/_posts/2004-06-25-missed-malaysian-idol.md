Missed Malaysian Idol
===

Arrgh! I missed the Malaysian Idol on 8TV channel! I watched only last few minutes of it, around 10.40PM. This time, it highlights contestants who participated in the audition at Johor Bharu, Johor. And I missed it, partially. Anyway, it's quite insignificant, because the **big** one will be next week's audition at Kuala Lumpur, where all qualified participants gather to compete. I must watch it!
