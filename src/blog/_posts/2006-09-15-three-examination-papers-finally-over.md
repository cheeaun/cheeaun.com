Three examination papers, finally over
===

For the last three days and nights, I have been burning the midnight oil, trying to catch up with the three subjects, Mathematics III, Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design, and Electronic Devices II. This is **torture**, I tell you. But fortunately, it's over now. The last paper was sure very hard. I doubt if I can score for the Electronic Devices II subject.

Anyway, I won't be worrying about that anymore. And ya, following those [Xgl craze](http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/09/06/vistas-ui-is-better-than-this/ "Vista's UI is Better Than This!?") lately, I've finally had the chance to [try out](http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/09/09/rubbing-xgl-in-windows-vistas-wounds/ "Rubbing XGL in Windows Vista's Wounds") the new [Kororaa Xgl Live CD](http://kororaa.org/ "Kororaa Project"), which I asked my friend, again, to [download it](http://tr.searching.com/view.php?id=406743 "Kororaa Linux Xgl LiveCD 0.2"). Gosh, it **really works!!** The rendering speed is **simply unbelievable**. And **fast**. I love it a lot.

I guess I don't to have say more or post screenshots here, just browse through the [xgl tags](http://technorati.com/tag/xgl) and you'll get the idea. Most of my friends were impressed. [Xgl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xgl) rocks!
