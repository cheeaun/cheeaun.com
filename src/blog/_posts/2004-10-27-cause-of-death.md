This tragedy [happened yesterday](http://thestar.com.my/news/archives/story.asp?file=/2004/10/27/nation/9241973 "Teen in love triangle killed"). A question arises as not to know how the deceased was killed, but rather how he was saved. If you read the news, you only know few bits of it. My classmate, Ranjeeta, **witnessed it**, and told my friends and I everything that *actually happened*.

According to Ranjeeta, when the incident happened, she and her younger brother went to help the injured teenager. Both of them tried to help him by controlling the blood flowing from his body and keep checking on his breathing. At that time, the girlfriend was emotionally unstable, sitting beside the guy in the car. Surprisingly, there were some people standing around and just staring at the poor fellow. **No one** dare to lend a hand. Ranjeeta was disappointed that those people actually stand there and do nothing! **Not even one** called the ambulance.

As her brother tried to ease the teenager's injury, she went to call 991, herself. Ironically, she was told to call 999 instead. When she called 999, the line **disengaged**. When the cadets from the Bagan Ajam Voluntary Fire-fighting Unit came to help, things became worse. They actually told Ranjeeta and her brother that it's not necessary to control the blood flow because it's just a minor problem. I'm not so sure about this, but is being stabbed a **minor problem**? The cadets start to take over and try to send the teenager to the hospital. They don't have a stretcher, so they just carry the guy by holding his legs and hands to their vehicle. Ranjeeta was surprised that **none** of the cadets were providing first aids to the victim. After the teenager was sent, the hospital ambulance just arrived, 20 minutes late.

He died.

I wonder, what is the *real* cause of his death? If *you* are in his position facing such problems, what would you feel?
