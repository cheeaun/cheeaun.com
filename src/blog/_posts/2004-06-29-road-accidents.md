Road accidents
===

I heard some bad news at school. There has been quite a number of road accidents lately. Last friday, an ex-student of my school passed away in a motorbike accident. My friend, Razman, who was the back passenger injured his arm. Yesterday evening, a form 5 female student of my school passed away in another motorbike accident. Coincidentally, both accidents happened in the rain. Many teachers were sad to hear the news. My friends and I were totally shocked. My condolence to the victims.
