<h1>A musical baton</h1>
<p>I&apos;ve been <a href="http://webtemplatesblog.com/archives/2005/05/24/musical-baton/" title="Musical Baton">passed a musical baton</a> by a <em>stranger</em> from <a href="http://webtemplatesblog.com/">Web Templates Blog</a>. Maybe <a href="http://webtemplatesblog.com/archives/2005/05/02/css-reboot/" title="CSS Reboot">not quite a stranger</a>, I supposed. I try checking out where this baton comes from, by jumping from link to link, going through various web pages, until finally I got lost in some LiveJournal sites. Such mystery, though it looks quite fun. I hope it&apos;s not too late for me to join in then.</p>

<dt>Total volume of music files on my computer</dt>
<dd><p>Technically speaking, this depends on the compression ratio, right? Or different sound formats such as MP3 and Ogg Vorbis? Okay, cut the crap, it&apos;s only <strong>1.54 Gb</strong>. Remember, I&apos;m on dial-up.</p></dd>
<dt>The last CD I bought</dt>
<dd><p><i>Qi Li Xiang</i> by Jay Chou, bought since last year. Most of the time, I borrow CD&apos;s from my friends instead, which is a much <em>cheaper</em> option, I think.</p></dd>
<dt>Song playing right now</dt>
<dd><p><i>Zhi Zhan Zhi Shang</i>  by Jay Chou. Nice. The lyrics by Vincent Fang is very good. Even the video clip is kind of cool.</p></dd>
<dt>Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me</dt>
<dd><p>I&apos;m a fan of Jay Chou, his <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/music/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB/" title="Audioscrobbler: Artist: Jay Chou">songs rock</a> and he&apos;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou" title="Jay Chou">popular</a>. So, there&apos;s no doubt that I always listen to his songs as few of them means quite a lot to me. Here I list five of my favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Hui Dao Guo Qu</i></li>
<li><i>Kai Bu Lou Kou</i></li>
<li><i>Qing Tian</i></li>
<li><i>Dong Feng Po</i></li>
<li><i>Ti Tian</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, all are Chinese songs. Mind you, I prefer them more than English ones.</p></dd>
<dt>Five people to whom I&apos;m passing the baton</dt>
