First examination paper
===

This morning, I just had my Basic Professional Writing examination paper. Basically speaking, it's quite easy, even though the summary section is a little confusing. Anyway, it's done. Next paper will be Digital Systems Design, one of my favourite subjects, this Thursday. Great.

I received my Ubuntu CDs today. A very nice package, complete with 8 CDs for PC, 1 for 64-bit PC, 1 for Mac and few pretty stickers. It's [Ubuntu version 6.06 LTS](http://ubuntu.com/news/606released). I know, I'm a little late in this but better be late than never, right? Haha. I haven't try it yet, but I did try [Kubuntu 6.06 LTS](http://kubuntu.org/announcements/6.06-lts-release.php) before, last month, which I asked my friend to download it. Still as cool as ever. I'm surprised that the distribution this time includes only 1 CD instead of 2 previously. A **2-in-1 CD**, both install CD and live CD. Wow.

Till then, stay tuned.
