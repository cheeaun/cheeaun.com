Year 2 begins
===

This week, my second year has started. Yes, I'm in Kuala Lumpur now, in Petaling Jaya, to be specific. I couldn't believe that my first year in UTAR is finished, just in a blink of an eye. Wow.

Okay, the subjects I'm taking for this semester seem to be *a little* harder. They are Digital Systems Design, Object-Oriented System Analysis and Design, Mathematics III, Electronic Devices II, and an elective subject, Basic Professional Writing. Sounds cool. Quite interesting too, especially since I have the chance to learn Java programming. Haha!

Just a note to myself, here's a list of things that I will do for the next few months, in no particular order:

- Redesign this homepage for the next [CSS Reboot](http://cssreboot.com/). Some ideas are already piling up in my brain, somehow.

- Get myself involved in freelancing. Something related to web design, of course.

- *Try* to take over the maintenance work of [Phoenity theme for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1406/ "Phoenity Firefox") from graciliano. But, please don't get too excited about it.

That's all, for now.
