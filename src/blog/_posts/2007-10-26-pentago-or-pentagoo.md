Pentago or Pentagoo?
===

Confused? Don't worry. It's just a project I've been doing for the past few months.

First, let me introduce the [Pentago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago):

> Pentago is a two-player abstract strategy game invented by Tomas Flodén. The Swedish company Mindtwister has the rights of developing and commercializing the product.
>
> The game is played on a 6×6 board divided into four 3×3 sub-boards (or quadrants). Taking turns, the two players place a marble of their colour (either black or white) onto an unoccupied space on the board, and then rotate one of the sub-boards by 90 degrees either clockwise or counter-clockwise. A player wins by getting five of their marbles in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row (either before or after the sub-board rotation in their move). If all 36 spaces on the board are occupied without a row of five being formed then the game is a draw.

I was introduced to this game was when I was working part-time. I personally find that this game is a genius! Simple yet *confusing*. It's the first I see a board game that involves some rotation mechanism. It really fits the name of the company behind it, **Mindtwister**.

Okay, enough with the story.

Now, let me introduce the [**Pentagoo**](http://pentagoo.googlecode.com/). Take note of the extra 'o'. The *online* Pentago game, written in Javascript. Yeah, I wrote the whole game from scratch. Haha. Quite a challenge for myself, though.

Actually, there are already some other projects and web sites for Pentago:

- [Pentago Online](http://www.pentago-online.se/choose.php) by Mindtwister
- [JPentago](http://code.google.com/p/jpentago/) by Doug Daniels and Matthew Hinds
- [JS Pentago](http://sourceforge.net/projects/js-pentago) by Jeff Smick
- [Gerry's Pentago](http://projects.gerryscuppatea.org/GerrysPentago/) by Gerry Beggs
- [PyPentago](http://pypentago.sourceforge.net/) by segfaulthunter
- [Pentago](http://mickael.rouvier.free.fr/pentago.php) by Rouvier Mickael

Some are very matured while some seems to be quite inactive. However, I decide to make my own version with more features and better interface. Therefore, Pentagoo is born. The current version has few interesting features such as sub-board rotation animation effects, keyboard control support, undo and history logging.

Following the recent [Adobe AIR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Air) craze, I've even made a desktop version of Pentagoo! It works on Windows Vista and though I never test it thoroughly, it should work on Windows XP and Mac OSX too. I've learnt some pretty cool stuff while developing Pentagoo with Adobe AIR. A very amazing technology, especially for web designers like me. Well obviously, it look almost, if not exactly, the same as the site, *but* with additional features like save game and sound effects! Sometimes, I just couldn't believe how easy it is to create a desktop application with Adobe AIR. **Simply unbelievable**.

The current version 0.1, which I've released two days ago, is ready for the public to play online or offline. I spent the last few weeks back in my hometown rewriting code and fixing bugs in the game. The **only problem** I got now is the lack of a decent **AI engine for the game**. I'm able to code, but Artificial Intelligence is just way over my capabilities. So, I would greatly appreciate any help from interested AI gurus out there. So do any comments, ideas or suggestions to improve the project!

The Pentagoo project is [currently hosted on Google Code](http://pentagoo.googlecode.com/ "Pentagoo"). Just spend some time playing it and spread the news!
