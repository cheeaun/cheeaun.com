SP404/1009
===

Today at school, all Upper Six students received their examination slips and the *official* timetables. I received mine and immediately check the details to ensure no error. The timetable paper seems to be in A3 size format and the contents are printed in *green* on white background. Odd colour combination, I thought. I looked at my slip and noticed that my candidate number is **SP404/1009**. It somehow reminded me of *Service Packs* and *404* error pages. *1009* sounds like a nice number, I supposed. Anyway, I'll be remembering this till the last day of the examination.
