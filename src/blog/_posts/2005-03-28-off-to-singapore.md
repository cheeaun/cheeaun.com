Off to Singapore
===

Tonight, my mother and I will be taking the travel bus, departing from Butterworth, Penang all the way to Singapore. We will be staying there for about a week and so far I know, my aunt's house don't have a computer and an Internet connection. So, I won't be around in cyberspace. Don't miss me, okay?
