Two wedding dinner
===

I've attended two wedding dinner. Yeah, *two* and it was quite a blast. One is [in Kuala Lumpur](http://chzehong.blogspot.com/2005/12/cocktail-preparation-101.html " Cocktail Preparation 101") last week on Saturday and the other is [in Penang island](http://chzehong.blogspot.com/2005/12/another-wedding-dinner.html "Another wedding dinner") just two days ago, but both is actually the same, which is my cousin's wedding anyway. She is my cousin, Melanie getting married with Richard. A lovely couple indeed...
