End of second semester of first year
===

I know, I haven't blog for three months. So let me assure to all readers of my blog that I'm **still alive**. Haha.

Okay now, what should I write here? Since I'm kind of lazy to type a lot, I guess I'll just use the *list* method, to summarise everything I've done. Here goes, in no particular order:

- In this second semester, the subjects I'm taking are Basic Microprocessor, Electronic Devices I, Mathematics II, <span lang="ms" title="Malaysian Studies">Pengajian Malaysia</span> and <span lang="ms" title="Moral Education">Pendidikan Moral</span>. Basic Microprocessor is my most favourite subject because I have the chance to learn Assembly programming language and do practicals with the *amazing* BGC-8088 board. The hardest subject for me is Electronic Devices because I have to memorize and apply so many circuitry concepts and theories, that it really blows up my head into pieces. Cool.

- Something bad happen to my USB flash drive a month ago. A *friend* of mine accidentally *snap* it when pulling it from the USB port socket. The 'head' or 'tip' of the drive, whatever you call it, *bends* slightly. This minor bend is enough to end the life of my 512Mb flash drive. How unlucky. So, I bought a **new one**! A **1Gb** flash drive, dude! Only **RM 170**!

- Besides, I also bought a portable audio player. Yeah, I mean a **MP3 player**. No, not iPod. Too expensive for my limited budget unfortunately. Instead, I bought the 5Gb [Creative Zen Micro](http://www.creative.com/products/mp3/zenmicro/), at a price of less than **RM 600**. I found few weaknesses, one of them is that the player requires software to transfer songs, especially Creative's own software. But anyway, I don't use them. [Winamp](http://winamp.com/) and [Nomad Zen Plugin](http://winampzenplugin.sourceforge.net/) are enough for my basic needs, even though I really, really wish there's a [YamiPod](http://www.yamipod.com/ "Yet another iPod manager") equivalent for Creative portable audio players.

- One of these days, the [brontok worm](http://google.com/search?q=brontok+worm "Google Search: brontok worm") or also known as [rontokbro worm](http://google.com/search?q=rontokbro+worm "rontokbro worm") is getting quite popular around my *neighbourhood*. All computers in UTAR got hit by this mass-mailing, blood-sucking worm. Few of my friends' computers and USB drives got hit too, due to their carelessness in differentiating between a folder and a file. Hmm... what is this worm got to with me then? Well, I turn out to be so-called a saviour to all my friends, by helping them to clean this **extremely stupid worm**.

	If *your* computer got hit by this worm, I think this [analysis page](http://www.compactbyte.com/brontok/ "Analisis Lengkap Virus Brontok") by Yohanes Nugroho would be useful. Note that this document is written in Malay. Very complete and updated.

- Oh ya, I would like to declare that I am now a fan of [Naruto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto)! This guy rocks! For now, I've watched the series till about 120 episodes, so I'm catching up as fast as possible. Pardon me.

- Last few weeks, I was having my examination papers and fortunately passed the three important subjects. Now I'm having my semester break. It's about time to go home, maybe next week.
