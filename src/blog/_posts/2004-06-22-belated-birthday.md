Belated birthday
===

Yesterday, I went to school and some of my friends wished me 'Happy Belated Birthday'. Today, I checked my emails and found out that some people, including Kah Peng, sent me belated birthday greetings. I'm not very sure about this but the word 'belated birthday' sounds very odd to me. Maybe I don't get used with it. Anyway, thanks to all.
