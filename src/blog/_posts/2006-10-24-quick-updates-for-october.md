Quick Updates for October
===

I admit I've been quite *inactive* here, so I'll type few things to confirm my existence. Here are some quick updates:

- For the last three weeks, I've attended a Linux System Administration course in UTAR. It was kind of fun and I could understand so much about the innards of the Linux system. [BASH](http://gnu.org/software/bash/) is so super cool that I've even installed it on Windows via [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)! And of course, I've tried the [Microsoft Virtual PC 2004](http://microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/) as well, and installed few Linux distributions.

	It's great. I've completed the course and got a certificate of achievement.

- Mozilla Firefox 2.0 will be released tomorrow! Or should I say [now, as of a day earlier?](http://slashdot.org/articles/06/10/23/2041252.shtml "Firefox 2.0 Posted a Day Early") Oops, no, it's [Tuesday](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2006/10/i_said_tuesday.html "i said tuesday!"), everyone. But I've downloaded it, not from the official FTP site, but from [filehippo.com](http://filehippo.com/download_firefox/ "Download Firefox"). I guess, this wouldn't kill the official FTP server, right?

- By around next few days, I'll be back to my hometown. It's time for my vacation. And <span lang="ms">Selamat Hari Raya</span> to all my Malay friends!
