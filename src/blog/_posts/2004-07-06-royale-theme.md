Ever heard of [Royale](http://neowin.net/comments.php?id=21800 "New Theme For Windows XP?")? Is it a [new theme for Windows XP](http://board.iexbeta.com/ibf10/index.php?showtopic=43478 "Windows XP new theme")? I don't know. The news leaked since end of last month, and I'm just about to find it out. As the matter a fact, I even downloaded and tested the new theme on my Windows XP system. It looks simply cool. The interface feels like Luna combined with a flavour of Aqua. Some posters in the forums wrote that the theme has the 'Media Center Style', whatever is it. Somehow, I always have the feeling that I've seen this before, maybe in other themes or desktop environments. I'm not sure if posting a screenshot of this theme would harm me, but I hope Microsoft *wouldn't mind*.
