Working CD-ROM
===

Yeah, my CD-ROM is **working**! And I don't even have to buy a new one. My neighbour of the same apartment, helped me to fix it by replacing some *burnt* electronic components with new ones on the circuit inside the CD-ROM. At the same time, he also taught me some *technical* stuff about the computer innards and hardware, so that I will know what to do next time. Whenever I reboot or use my computer, he's so surprised to know that I'm a *software freak*. I've set a **tri-boot system** for Redhat Linux, Windows 98 and Windows XP, yet there are **more than 100 software** installed on my 20-Gigabyte hard disk. Now wonder it scares so many people.

Anyway, thanks a lot to my neighbour!
