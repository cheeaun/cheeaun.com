Dead hard drive
===

I have bad news.

My computer died. To be specific, my hard disk drive died. Peacefully.

My tri-boot system is gone. All my music files are gone. All my *experiments* and things I learnt are gone. All my artwork including the Phoenity source files are gone. **All gone.**

Hard drive recovery is not my expertise. Please, I need help.

**Update 22 November 2005**: It seems that my hard drive is not *completely* dead but *virtually* dead. It simply ticks when the computer boots. Weird.
