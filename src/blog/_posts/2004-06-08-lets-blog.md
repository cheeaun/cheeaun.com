Let's blog
===

Weblogs are everywhere. My friend, Kah Peng, has a weblog. My cousin, Chze Hong, has a weblog. Quite a number of Malaysians have weblogs. Even newspapers keep reporting about the widespread of weblogs. So, what is the fuss here? Why is this phenomenon affecting me so much? I don't care of [MovableType](http://movabletype.org/). I don't care of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). I just simply want to blog, that's all.

Well, the fact is I want to experience the wonderful world of blogging. From today onwards, I'm officially declaring myself a blogger!
