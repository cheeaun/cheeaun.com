Better browser
===

Firefox is truly a [better browser](http://betterbrowser.org/) with [new features coming up](http://neilturner.me.uk/2004/Jul/12/new_features_for_firefox_10.html "New features for Firefox 1.0") for version 1.0. The recent popularity of Firefox sparks *more* [interesting Firefox switch sites](http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/07/12/switch_to_firefox_better_browser_sites.php "\"Switch to Firefox\", better browser sites") made by Firefox fans. There is also a [new spell checking extension](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/005998.html "spell checking for firefox made almost easy") for Firefox 0.9+ called [SpellBound](http://exchangecode.com/spellbound/), which is *exactly* what I want for blogging. Sometimes, I just couldn't wait to try out the [latest 0.9 releases](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-0.9/ "Index of /pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-0.9"). Using the [bitoogle](http://bitoogle.com/) technology, I can easily find for [Firefox torrent files](http://search.bitoogle.com/search.php?q=firefox "bitoogle search: firefox") and download them faster.
