STPM phobia
===

[SPM and STAM results](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2005/3/4/nation/10321833 "SPM, STAM results out on Thursday") will be out on Thursday. I read this over and over again in the newspaper, and couldn't find the STPM abbreviation. SPM is not STPM, and STAM is not STPM too. So, when will the STPM results be out? I try to calm down and read it again.

Okay, I'm not sure if this is good news or bad news. I now realised that I'm having **post-STPM phobia**. Any cure?
