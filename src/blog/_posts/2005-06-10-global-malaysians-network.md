Global Malaysians Network
===

Today, I just read the news that the [Global Malaysians Network](http://globalmalaysians.com/), a project to link Malaysians globally, has been launched.

I myself, being a web standards enthusiast, am **totally amazed** by its [wonderful HTML codes](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://globalmalaysians.com/ "Validation Results for http://globalmalaysians.com/"). I supposed they expect some of their target visitors are *still* using Netscape 4. Fortunately, the site's [CSS validates](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://globalmalaysians.com/ "W3C CSS Validator Results for http://globalmalaysians.com/") quite well, with few warnings and one *weird* class selector called `arial_8pt`. The whole design is optimised for 800Ã—600px resolution and the text links seem to react in a strange and inconsistent way. The [forum](http://globalmalaysians.com/forum/) is a good start to gather all Malaysians and discuss Malaysian stuff. If you're wondering, the forum is powered by [Web Wiz Forums](http://webwizguide.info/web_wiz_forums/) version **7.01**, and don't be surprised that the current updated version is **7.91**.

Anyway, the logo is beautiful, maybe a little too dark though I don't understand why is there a *black rectangle shape* behind the globe?
