Kampung on fire
===

There's a <span lang="ms" title="village">kampung</span> house on fire near my apartment just now. I witnessed it from the balcony at fifth floor of my apartment. Frankly speaking, it's the first time I see such **huge** fire with so much smoke rising to the atmosphere. I could see nearby residents quickly pack up their things and run. Then I heard sirens from fire engines arriving to put out the fire. In just few minutes, the fire engulfed **three** <span lang="ms">kampung</span> houses and left only dark ashes. My deepest sympathy to the victims.
