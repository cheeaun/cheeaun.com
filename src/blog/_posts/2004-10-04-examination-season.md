Examination season
===

It's the month of October, the *examination season*. My STPM exam will start next month. Most of my classmates were absent from school today. I supposed they're studying at home. Since truancy is not part of my vocabulary, I went to school to study, at least did some revisions. Somehow, my eyes felt so tired and I had a slight headache. The weather was rather cold because it rained this morning and drizzled in the evening. I hope tomorrow will be a better day.
