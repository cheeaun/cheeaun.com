Back from two wedding dinners
===

Okay, I'm a little late to post what I did since the beginning of December. I was kind of busy with my sister's wedding and stuff. It all happens when I got back to Penang last month, went to Singapore with my parents and aunts, stayed there for few days, went back to Penang again and finally back here in Petaling Jaya. Wow.

I've attended not one but **two** wedding dinners! One in Singapore and the other is on Penang island. Both are related to my sister and her lovely newly-wed husband. It was tiring, but now I know how people organise wedding events. Quite an experience for me. Haha.

I'm back since last Sunday and now working on my part-time job again. Period.
