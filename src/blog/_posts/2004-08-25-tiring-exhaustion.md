Tiring exhaustion
===

Boy, I'm so tired! Early morning, I woke up and went to PA tuition at 9.15AM. After 2 hours and 15 minutes, I walked out of the tuition center and found out that it was raining. Taking bus, I managed to reach home, almost soaked with rain water. I didn't eat much and directly went to Mathematics tuition. The lessons started at 1.30 and ended at 6.30, a total of **5 long hours**! By that time, I was so exhausted *and* hungry. I better get some rest.
