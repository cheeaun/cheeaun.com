Malaysian Idol
===

I've heard of [American Idol](http://idolonfox.com/). I've also heard of the inspirational [William Hung](http://williamhung.net/). Just now, I watched the [Malaysian Idol](http://www.malaysianidol.com.my/main.asp) on 8TV channel. It's their second stop at Kuching where the judges find for talents. The first stop was at Penang last week, which I've watched only a bit. Anyway, the audition really made me laugh! Some *talented* Malaysians actually perform *ridiculous* things in front of the judges! Unbelievable!
