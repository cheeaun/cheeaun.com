Double Surprises
===

This morning, the weather was better than yesterday. I felt energetic throughout the lessons conducted in my class. After school, I went to my <span lang="ms" title="General Studies">Pengajian Am</span> tuition. Later, I went home and had few minutes to get online. Once connected, I immediately checked out [MozillaZine](http://mozillazine.org/) and my bloglines. I had *two surprises*.

One, [Mozilla Firefox 0.9 released!](http://mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=4843 "Mozilla Firefox 0.9 Released") I immediately download it! While downloading in the background, I read the [release notes](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/0.9.html "Mozilla Firefox 0.9 Release Notes") and found the new [Mozilla Update](http://update.mozilla.org/), which serves as a *repository* for themes and extensions. At the same time, I also found the new [Mozilla Store](http://mozillastore.com/), selling some cool Mozilla stuff. Really, I like the [Firefox T-shirt](http://mozillastore.com/products/clothing/firefoxtshirt) very much. The downloading process took 23 minutes and 2 seconds. After that, I didn't install it, yet, because I need to back up my bookmarks and customisations, just in case if anything get messed up. I think I'll do everything by tomorrow.

Two, I'm [one of the winners](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/005700.html "and the winners are...") of Asa's [Gmail giveaway drawing](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/005695.html "massive gmail giveaway bonanza")! Wow, this is so great! Thanks a lot, Asa! I fired up my email client to contact him so that he can send me the invitation link. Also to prove that I'm still alive, and *not* merely someone who happens to pass by his weblog and post something there just to get Gmail. In the next few days, I might post my experiences using [this email service](http://gmail.google.com/ "Gmail").

By the way, I noticed that my Winstripe-related posts few days ago [received some attention](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/005707.html "Winstripe Reloaded") from the [Firefox community](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=575274 "Constructive criticism: Winstripe"). Steven Garrity, the Visual Design Coordinator of the Firefox project, has taken my posts to the Mozilla Visual Identity Team. Whoa, I never thought that my *amateurish* opinions on icons design are being reviewed by experts. I guess I should be *more careful* next time when posting my opinions online.
