Firefox 1.0 party in Malaysia
===

I couldn't believe my eyes. Someone named karsoon has [initiated a party](http://openforce.at/mozparty2/?party=210 "It's your web taking back day! Firefox 1.0 Rules.") in [Malaysia](http://openforce.at/mozparty2/?view=MY "Parties in Malaysia")! The location hasn't been settled yet, but I don't see Penang listed there, unfortunately. Even more surprising, **more than 10 Malaysians** will be attending the party! And I don't even recognise them all! Immediately, I take this chance to contact those people. Some of them replied. Good.

I couldn't attend the party nor suggest a party in Penang, because I have examination. What an excuse, I know. But I do hope more Malaysians could join and have fun!
