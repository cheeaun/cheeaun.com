20062006 Birthday
===

Today is [June 20](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_20). It's the day [Petaling Jaya becoming a city](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/6/19/nation/14581312 "Cool response to PJ becoming a city"). It's also the day [Opera 9 is released](http://operawatch.com/news/2006/06/opera-9-released.html "Opera 9 Released").

It's my **21<sup>st</sup> birthday**, too.

Though I got to say this is the first time I spend my birthday in Kuala Lumpur, I would like to thank all my friends for wishing me happy birthday!
