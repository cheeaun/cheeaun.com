Free Service Pack
===

Unbelievable. I can [get Windows XP Service Pack 2 CD for free](http://liewcf.com/wp/archives/2004/08/get-windows-xp-sp2-cd-for-free/)? Or does it mean that I can [order it for free](http://microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/sp2/cdorder/en_us/ "Order Windows XP Service Pack 2 on CD")? The CD order page quoted:

> Thank you for your interest in the Windows XP Service Pack 2 CD. Microsoft will ship the CD to you free of charge.

I guess I'm not dreaming then. I give it a try anyway, and see if it arrives at my doorstep by next 4-6 weeks.
