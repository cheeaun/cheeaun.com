Spreading Firefox
===

Wow. These days, Firefox is [spreading so fast](http://spreadfirefox.com/ "Spread Firefox")! So many things happened and I'm so slow to catch up. [Mozilla Firefox 1.0 Preview Release](http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=5271 "Firefox Preview Release Available, Spreadfirefox.com in Beta") is now available, and I encourage **everyone** to [get it](http://getfirefox.com/ "Get Firefox") while it's hot! I know that my Phoenity theme is not yet ready for it, so please be patient. I hope this won't be an excuse for anyone *not* to download the Preview Release.

By the way, kudos to Kevin Karpenske of [Quailish.com](http://quailish.com/) for contributing the [Firefox.com](http://firefox.com/) domain!
