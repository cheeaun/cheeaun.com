PA Paper 1 and Physics Paper 1
===

Today is the last day of STPM. Early morning, the PA paper was quite okay. I was surprised to see a special piece of paper placed beside the examination paper. It's called the <span lang="ms" title="Error">Ralat</span> paper, containing a corrected version of question number 41 of the original PA paper. Whoa, it's the first time I see an error occurred in a governmental examination. For me, the PA paper was pretty easy, but the Physics paper was  *hard*. Anyway, both are objective papers, so the probability of getting the correct answer for each question is only a quarter. After the examination, my friends and I felt **so relieved**, though a bit tired.

Finally, **STPM is over! Yeah!**
