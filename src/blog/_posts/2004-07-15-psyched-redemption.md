Psyched redemption
===

From Chu Yeow's [*redemptive* blog post](http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/07/15/cant_ditch_ie_because_of_google_pagerank_now_you_can.php "Can't ditch IE because of Google PageRank? Now you can"), I found the neat [Google Pagerank extension](http://pagerankstatus.mozdev.org/) for Firefox, created by Stephane Queraud. It works like the [web-based Google PageRank check site](http://freelance-help.com/google-ranking-report/page-rank.php), but *more convenient*, located at the status bar of the browser. It covers all the 10 rankings that Google offers and I'm glad to see that my Phoenity site got 6 out of 10.

From Gemal's [*psyched* blog post](http://gemal.dk/archives/000616.html "Taming the Beast: The Solution to Mozilla's Hidden Marketing Problem"), I found a rather [lengthy but interesting essay](http://andkon.com/stuf/mozillanewstrategy/ "Taming the Beast: The Solution to Mozilla's Hidden Marketing Problem") by Andkon. It's mainly about Mozilla's *user-unfriendly* web site design. I really respect this person for writing such perceptive piece of work. There is one specific sentence which sounds *quite sarcastic*:

> The Mozilla Suite doesn't fit into this scheme because it's a bloated program that's clumsy to use.

If so, should the Mozilla developers ditch off the Mozilla Suite? I don't use it much, but I still have the *old* Mozilla 1.0 installed on my hard disk. It was a great software, but now Firefox has been the browser of my choice. Anyway, I am not familiar with the development process of Mozilla Suite either.
