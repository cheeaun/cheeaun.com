Gmail rumours
===

Navin told me that Google will not give Gmail invitation links to users anymore. He pointed me to [a discussion forum of the KVPUG community](http://kvpug.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8858 "Google bans GMail sales"), where I could read it all happens, thanks to recent [Gmail exploitations and misusage](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3859501.stm "Google bans Gmail sales"). Some users don't get invitation links any more while others report *missing* invitation links. This sounds odd because I believe that Google will not take such actions, as quoted on the [BBC news article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3859501.stm "Google bans Gmail sales"):

So, I guess those are just rumours. As long as I'm on Gmail now, I don't care much anyway. What I care now is that I can finally [import my contacts into Gmail](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_07_05_index.html#108901495993314419 "Import Contacts Into Gmail")! Yeah!
