Fractured arm
===

Last Friday, a friend of mine, Tang Yiu Maeng, was injured felling onto the ground when playing basketball. Fortunately, his arm had a minor fracture. My friends told me that the doctor advised him not to go to school for at least 6 weeks. Surprisingly enough, he came today, wearing a triangular bandage around his right arm. Everyone's glad to see him. Now that his right arm is impaired, he has learned using his left hand to write. Hope he'll recover soon.
