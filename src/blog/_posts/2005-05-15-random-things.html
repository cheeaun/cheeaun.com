<h1>Random things</h1>
<p>Things that <strong>annoy</strong> me:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="../images/screenshots/firefox/subscribe_to_rss_2.0_rss_.92_atom_0.3.png" width="190" height="100" alt="list of subscription feeds ranging from RSS 2.0, RSS .92 to Atom 0.3 formats displayed from the menu popup of the &apos;Live Bookmarks&apos; button on the statusbar">
<p>Whenever I visit <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>-powered weblogs and also some other sites, I always notice some bunch of feeds listed from the Live Bookmarks button on the statusbar. In my opinion, providing visitors with such <em>choices</em> of feeds is unnecessary. All of them may differ in their formats, but they serve the <strong>exact same purpose</strong>. Even the title of the feeds reflects the type of its format instead of its content. From the visitors&apos; point of view, who cares of the various formats as long as it&apos;s functional, right?</p></li>
<li><p>I may be geeky in some technology stuff but don&apos;t be surprised that I <strong>have not</strong> jump into the broadband bandwagon yet. Yes, I&apos;m <em>still</em> on dial-up, and no, it doesn&apos;t annoy me, yet. The thing that annoys me is this PHP code actually:</p>
<pre><code>header(&apos;Pragma: no-cache&apos;);</code></pre>
<p>This line of code prevents me from viewing that page in offline mode. So do other dial-up users. I hate it.</p></li>
<li><p>Last time, graphical banner advertisements tend to hurt my eyes a lot, so I use the <a href="http://mozilla.org/support/firefox/adblock" title="Blocking Advertisement">advertisement-blocking list</a> for my Firefox. After months of surfing <em>advertisement-free</em> web sites, I start to miss the advertisements so much and decided to remove the codes list then. It&apos;s a weird feeling but I felt great looking at those <em>beautiful graphics</em>. Recently, I found out that many sites are implementing <a href="http://google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> advertisements. I began to get tired looking at them. When visiting <a href="http://liewcf.com/" title="Tech Gadgets Blog">LiewCF.com</a>, my eyes are always distracted by the textual and graphical advertisements around the content. It&apos;s <em>too much</em>. Immediately, I add this code to the &apos;userContent.css&apos; file:</p>
<pre><code>iframe[name=&quot;google_ads_frame&quot;],
#leftsidebar table.adstrip{
display: none !important;
}</code></pre>
<p>Basically, the first line refers to Adsense advertisements displayed in <em>any</em> web sites and the second refers to some other advertisements positioned in the sidebar of <a href="http://liewcf.com/" title="Tech Gadgets Blog">LiewCF.com</a>. The CSS code <code>display: none</code> removes both of them from view. Yay.</p></li>
<li><p>On April 25 2005, Mack Zulkifli wrote <a href="http://brandmalaysia.com/movabletype/archives/2005/04/malaysia_-_the.html" title="Malaysia, do we care enough?">an article about providing accessibility features for the disabled</a>. I admire his effort to help the disabled people in Malaysia and spread this issue to other bloggers. However, I could see an irony here. If he cares for the disabled people like Peter Tan, he should have know about the <a href="http://w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a> too. The codes for the banner are the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brandmalaysia.com/movabletype/archives/2005/04/malaysia_-_the.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;<strong>blogdemand.png</strong>&quot; src=&quot;http://www.brandmalaysia.com/movabletype/archives/blogdemand.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&apos;m not an expert in accessibility but I know this couldn&apos;t even satisfy a <strong>Priority 1</strong> <a href="http://w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#tech-text-equivalent" title="Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content">checkpoint 1.1</a>! It&apos;s because of the <del datetime="2005-05-17T11:56+08:00">missing</del> <ins datetime="2005-05-17T11:56+08:00">inappropriate value for the</ins> <code>alt</code> attribute! So, what does this mean? Mack quoted on his site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone clicking on the small banner will be redirected to this post, so that they too may be privy to the plight that I have raised.</p>
<p>â€” <a href="http://brandmalaysia.com/movabletype/archives/2005/04/malaysia_-_the.html">http://brandmalaysia.com/movabletype/archives/2005/04/malaysia_-_the.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Not anyone</strong>, Mack. Not anyone. Only some. It may not be accessible to non-disabled people too. For those thinking that web accessibility is useless, please <a href="http://contenu.nu/socog.html" title="Reader&apos;s guide to Sydney Olympics accessibility complaint">think again</a>.</p></li>

<p>Things that I&apos;ve <strong>discovered</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These few months, I was surprised to find that some of my weblog traffic come from <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a>. Huh? How come? Well, all thanks to my <em>special</em> file naming schemes and <em>taxonomical</em> archiving techniques for the images displayed on my weblog. Instead of using <em>date</em>-centric archiving for the images, like weblog entries, I use <strong>data</strong>-centric archiving because it should be a better way in my humble opinion. If you are wondering, I learn these familiar <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/03/25/dateCentricVsEntryCentric" title="Date-centric vs Entry-centric">technical terms</a> from Simon Willison&apos;s <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">weblog</a>. In other words, the images are stored according to categories and their file names are made to exhibit the <em>semantics</em> of the images, thus making them friendly to search engines. Check it out!</p></li>
<li><img src="../images/screenshots/software/hyperlink_address_opera_illegal_url_0_12_tooltip_text_opera_8.png" width="185" height="165" alt="two instances, one showing a cursor hovering over a hyperlink with a tooltip &apos;Address: opera:illegal-url-0&apos;, the other also similar but with the tooltip &apos;Address: opera:illegal-url-12&apos;">
<p>I&apos;ve accidentally discovered a rather unique <em>feature</em> in Opera 8. Let&apos;s say I have a HTML page coded as such:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;<em>http://&apos;.com/</em>&quot;&gt;hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Okay I know it&apos;s invalid HTML, but that&apos;s not what I&apos;m emphasizing. Observe carefully and notice an invalid character in the URL. It&apos;s only a single quote. Opera 8 intelligently identifies it as an <em>illegal</em> URL and redirects it to <kbd>opera:illegal-url-0</kbd> instead. Clicking the link shows an &apos;Illegal URL&apos; page. Go back, reload the page, and you&apos;ll notice the URL changes to <kbd>opera:illegal-url-1</kbd>. Repeat the process, and <kbd>opera:illegal-url-2</kbd> will show up, later <kbd>opera:illegal-url-3</kbd>, <kbd>opera:illegal-url-4</kbd> and so on. Weird. A bug, I guess?</p></li>
<li><img src="../images/screenshots/firefox/cramped_live_bookmarks_toolbar_shorten_feed_items_list_menu_popup.png" width="250" height="270" alt="live bookmarks on the bookmarks toolbar being cramped together and the virtually shorten feed items list displayed on the menu popup of the live bookmark button">
<p>I have a folder called &apos;Livemarks&apos; in my bookmarks. It stores all subscribed live bookmarks and is set as the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder so that I can access it easily during my surfing activity. Most of these live bookmarks are the ones I&apos;ll read more often than my <a href="http://bloglines.com/public/cheeaun/" title="cheeaun&apos;s Bloglines">Bloglines subscriptions</a>. As time goes by, the live bookmarks accumulated and expanded more than the whole width of the bookmarks toolbar. In order to <em>cramp</em> all of them to fit in the toolbar, I&apos;ve applied this piece of code to &apos;userChrome.css&apos;:</p>
<pre><code><em class="remark">/*specify width of bookmarks toolbar buttons*/</em>
#bookmarks-ptf toolbarbutton.bookmark-item{
max-width: 50px !important;
}

<em class="remark">/*hide all other stuff except the bookmarks label*/</em>
#bookmarks-ptf toolbarbutton.bookmark-item &gt; .toolbarbutton-menu-dropmarker,
#bookmarks-ptf toolbarbutton.bookmark-item &gt; .toolbarbutton-icon{
display: none !important;
}</code></pre>
<p>Since Firefox doesn&apos;t have an option to limit the number of listed feed items, I simply make it <em>virtually shorter</em>, with these codes, also applied to &apos;userChrome.css&apos;:</p>
<pre><code>.bookmark-item[livemark=&quot;true&quot;] &gt; menupopup{
max-height: 22em;
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>It seems that there <em>are</em> some Malaysians, especially web designers, who don&apos;t know about Internet Explorer&apos;s <em>famous</em> CSS box model bug. I <strong>almost laughed</strong> when I read these pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kahsoon.com/2005/05/13/killer-wordpress-template/">Killer Wordpress Template</a></li>
<li><a href="http://liewcf.com/blog/archives/2005/05/internet-explorer-padding-and-width/">Internet Explorer, Padding and Width</a></li>
<li><a href="http://malaysiabloggers.com/showthread.php?t=439">Look at my new template and tell me whats wrong</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Any CSS enthusiasts should understand what I felt about them. Sigh.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Things that I&apos;m <strong>experimenting</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of my experiments is to <a href="http://fiftyfoureleven.com/sandbox/2004/feb/gzipping-your-css-with-php/" title="Gzipping your CSS with PHP">compress CSS files</a>, producing smaller file size and increasing the download speed. Just have a look at the codes I use, slightly <em>enhanced</em>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
ob_start(&quot;ob_gzhandler&quot;);
header(&quot;Content-type: text/css&quot;);
header(&quot;Cache-Control: must-revalidate&quot;);
$offset = 60 * 60; <em class="remark">// 3600 seconds = 1hr</em>
$ExpStr = &quot;Expires: &quot; . gmdate(&quot;D, d M Y H:i:s&quot;, time() + $offset) . &quot; GMT&quot;;
header($ExpStr);

<em class="remark">// removes all carriage returns and line feeds</em>
function cleanup($crlf) {
return (preg_replace(&quot;&apos;[\r\n]+&apos;&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $crlf));
}

ob_start(&quot;cleanup&quot;);

include (&quot;green-mind.css&quot;); <em class="remark">// include the CSS file</em>

ob_end_flush();
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&apos;m not a PHP expert so I hope this wouldn&apos;t cause any serious rendering quirks or browser problems though.</p></li>
<li><p>I also play around with some <em>standard nuggets</em> to send an HTTP 1.0 Link header with the page, found from the <a href="http://sitepoint.com/newsletter/">SitePoint newsletters</a>. It&apos;s pretty cool because this technique is done via some web server configuration or server-side scripting, without even touching the markup codes. The link header can be added with PHP:</p>
<pre><code>header(&apos;Link: &lt;style.css&gt;; rel=stylesheet&apos;);</code></pre>
<p>Using this technique, I have some CSS fun, linking the page to a stylesheet containing Mozilla-proprietary CSS codes, especially the <code>::moz-selection</code> selector which I first discovered from Ming Hong&apos;s <a href="http://minghong.blogspot.com/" title="Just Another Blog">site</a> stylesheet. If you are using Mozilla or Firefox browser, you should notice how awesome it is.</p></li>
</ul>
