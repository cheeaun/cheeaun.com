End of first semester of first year
===

It's been a week, since my last examination paper on Monday. It's Circuit Theory, harder than my previous three papers. For these few days, I'm still in Millennium Court, just waiting for the results to come out. If I pass all subjects, I can go back home right away, else I would have to take supplementary papers.

This morning, I found that I've passed all the four subjects. It's time for me to go back Penang. I'll be back here again for my second semester next year. Yeah.
