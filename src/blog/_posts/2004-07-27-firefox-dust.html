<h1>Firefox Dust</h1>
<p>I&apos;ve <em>quietly</em> released Phoenity 1.2 for Firefox yesterday night. It&apos;s a huge update with lots of fixes and changes, especially the bug fix with <a href="http://googlebar.mozdev.org/">Googlebar</a> extension. The updating process has taken me weeks, because I need to examine every single code, study its functionality, understand its purpose, and implement them in a right manner. If you read the CSS files of the &apos;phoenity.jar&apos; file, you might notice that I&apos;ve added some of my own codes, with explanatory comments.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I play around the innards of Firefox, I tend to discover things that most of you probably won&apos;t. My eyes are amazingly <em>too sharp</em> to spot even the <em>tiniest</em> speck of dust. Some of them are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/blog/images/screenshots/firefox/space_use_theme_menuitem_popup_themes_manager.png" width="220" height="140" alt="extra space by the &apos;Use Theme&apos; menu item on the right-click menu popup of the themes list in the Themes Manager">
<p>Go to the Themes Manager and right-click on the themes list. See anything there? Focus your eyes on an <em>extra</em> space by the &apos;Use Theme&apos; menu item. Yes, that is a non-breaking space character. Via DOM Inspector, I found out that one of the developers might have accidentally press the space bar before typing out the label of the menu item.</p></li>
<li><img src="/blog/images/screenshots/firefox/character_coding_encoding_menu_menupopup_firebird_firefox.png" width="400" height="235" alt="two menu popups, one showing the &apos;Character Coding&apos; menu item in Mozilla Firebird 0.7, the other showing the &apos;Character Encoding&apos; menu item in Mozilla Firefox 0.9.2">
<p>Go to &apos;View&apos; menu and take a <em>long</em> look at the menu popup, especially the &apos;Character Encoding&apos; menu. I&apos;m not sure <em>when</em> the developers changed this, but when I tried launching Firebird 0.7, I noticed that it was spelled as &apos;Character Coding&apos; instead of &apos;Character Encoding&apos;. I wonder what&apos;s the difference anyway?</p></li>
<li><img src="/blog/images/screenshots/firefox/twisties_plus_winstripe_luna.png" width="190" height="130" alt="two twisties, one is Winstripe&apos;s, the other is Luna&apos;s">
<p>The twisties in Firefox may look like Windows XP Luna&apos;s, but actually it&apos;s <em>not</em>. Zooming it few times will reveal its true non-native nature. The colours are totally different despite its familiar sign. This is not good, because in my opinion, the twisties should follow the native look of the system environment. I supposed Linux&apos;s desktop environments have different type of twisties, right?</p></li>
<li><img src="/blog/images/screenshots/firefox/text_cursor_menuitems_popup_search_textbox_bookmarks_sidebar.png" width="190" height="160" alt="unchanged text cursor hovering over the right-click popup of the Search text box from the Bookmarks sidebar">
<p>Open the Search or History sidebar, point to the search text box, right-click, then move your cursor over the popup. You&apos;ll find out that the cursor is <em>still</em> in text mode. By default, it should be in pointer mode as it hovers over the popup. This <em>minor bug</em> also happens for the text box of the Javascript Console, and it can be fixed with this code:</p>
<pre><code>.textbox-input-box menupopup{
<em>cursor: default;</em>
}</code></pre></li>
<li><img src="/blog/images/screenshots/firefox/non_disabled_check_mark_checked_menuitem_popup_tree_column_picker_bookmarks_manager.png" width="160" height="190" alt="non-disabled check mark of a disabled checked menu item on the popup generated from the tree column picker in the Bookmarks Manager">
<p>Launch the Bookmarks Manager, then click the tree column picker button which will show a popup. On the popup, you could see that the &apos;Name&apos; menu item is disabled, but the check mark is <em>not</em> in disabled state. By right, it should be grayed out like its label, just to indicate that the <em>whole</em> menu item is disabled and cannot be unchecked anymore. I was confused the first time spotting it and even tried clicking on it, out of curiosity.</p></li>
<li><img src="/blog/images/screenshots/firefox/incorrect_background_colour_caption_groupbox_advanced_panel.png" width="230" height="190" alt="caption of a groupbox showing an incorrect background colour, which interferes with the background color of the list box">
<p>Launch the Options window, go to Advanced panel, and expand the Certificates section. The caption for the group box seems to <em>interfere</em> with the background colour of the list box. The colour is actually the system dialog background colour. This bug can be easily fixed with this code:</p>
<pre><code>.listBox caption{
<em>background-color: -moz-field;</em>
}</code></pre></li>
<li><img src="/blog/images/screenshots/firefox/disabled_menuitems_shadow_firefox_ie.png" width="390" height="185" alt="two menu popups, one showing the non-shadowed disabled menu items in Mozilla Firefox, the other showing shadowed disabled menu items in Internet Explorer">
<p>For Windows Classic, disabled menu items should have text shadows, but unfortunately there aren&apos;t any in Firefox. I tried to achieve such effect by using the <code>text-shadow</code> CSS property but Gecko doesn&apos;t support it yet. I even tried other methods and ended up using complicated piles of XBL bindings, which seems so redundant. If Gecko can support <code>text-shadow</code>, I could just create the shadows with this piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>label[disabled=&quot;true&quot;],
*[disabled=&quot;true&quot;] &gt; label{
<em>text-shadow: 1px 1px ThreedHighLight;</em>
}</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>I think, this is all for now.</p>
