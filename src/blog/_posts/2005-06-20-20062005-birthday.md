20062005 Birthday
===

Today is a special day. Today's date is special too. It's **20th of June, 2005**, also can be presented as **20.06.2005**.

Just this morning, I read [The Star](http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2005/6/20/features/11243748 "Bloggers 'r' us") and saw few [Malaysian faces from the blogosphere](http://petertan.com/blog/archives/2005/06/bloggers_r_us.html "Bloggers 'r' us") featured in an article written by Michael Cheang. I looked at the [Petaling Street](http://petalingstreet.org/) and found that today is also GeminiGeek's [birthday](http://blog.geminigeek.com/archives/2005/06/happy-birthday-to-me/ "Happy Birthday To ME"). Then a peek at [Technorati](http://technorati.com/tag/birthday "Technorati: Tag: birthday") pointed me to a site called [Birthday Calculator](http://paulsadowski.com/birthday.asp). It's a cool site that tells me, as of now, I'm 20 years old, 240 months old, 1044 weeks old <del datetime="2005-06-27T18:22+08:00">and</del> <ins datetime="2005-06-27T18:22+08:00">or</ins> 7305 days old! Neat!
