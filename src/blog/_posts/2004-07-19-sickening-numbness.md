Sickening numbness
===

I'm sick today, catching a cold. At school, majority of Lower 6 students were absent. Why, I asked? Because of the orientation two days ago. *What a ridiculous excuse*. They are so smart to make this as their *perfect* excuse **not** to come to school. But then, maybe they got sick too, like me? I know that my classmate, Teoh Hock Lye, also falls sick, a bit more serious than my condition. He has some sort of gastric or stomach ache. I hope he'll be alright tomorrow, including myself. This cold is making me feel so numb.
