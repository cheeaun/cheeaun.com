Malaysian Idol Finalists
===

Yeah, it's the Malaysian Idol 12 finalists! I watched it live on 8TV and their performances are simply amazing, though some of them got *harsh* critiques from the judges, especially Paul Moss. Saiful, being the first contestant to sing on the stage, performed quite badly, mainly because he had a fever. Andrew looks very calm and elegant when he sang in front of the audience. Dina really surprised me when she sang 'When You Believe', because her voice was projected so much like Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston!

After the singing, the voting process starts right away via SMS or phone call. People from all over the country will choose their first ever *Malaysian idol*. Among the 12 finalists, I'm not sure who would I choose. Sigh.
