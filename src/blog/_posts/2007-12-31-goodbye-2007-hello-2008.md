Goodbye 2007, Hello 2008
===

Now is the time for me to wrap up what I've done in 2007. It's been great, so let's do a little list here:

- I've gone though two hard semesters and now I'm a third-year student. Wow. Time flies. It almost felt like a dream. Examinations, tests, projects and homeworks. Next year will mark the beginning of my very last semester, before graduating!

- I've launched my [Death Note](http://deathnoteonline.com/) site on January, which is now discontinued due to some reasons. I'll elaborate further about it in my next post. But anyway, it's really quite an experience for me.

- I got myself a new mobile phone, [Nokia 5300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5300), bought my own laptop and tried the great Windows Vista. These gadgets improve my life a lot.

- Since I'm so busy sometimes, I manage to start a tumblelog, which is snazzily titled [cheeauntumb](http://cheeaun.tumblr.com/). Even though this blog is not updated frequently, I'll be updating my tumblelog often because it's easier and faster. [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) rocks.

- I started **three projects**, [Pentagoo](http://pentagoo.googlecode.com/), [Fx.WindowBounds](http://fx-windowbounds.googlecode.com/) and [MooEditable](http://mooeditable.googlecode.com/), all hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/). Sounds a lot? Maybe this explains why I'm so busy? Haha. Just last week, I've even redesigned and launched [PenangBloggers.com](http://penangbloggers.com/). Yeah, I need more than 24 hours a day!

- Last month, I went to [Genting](http://www.genting.com.my/) with my friends. **It's my first time and it's very, very great!**

Okay, this pretty much wraps up everything. Also, I've been planning quite few things for the new year 2008. One of them [is in progress](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=615668 "http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=615668").

**Happy New Year to everyone.**
