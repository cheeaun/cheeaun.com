Keywords of life

These keywords describe what happened to me since that last time I post here:

- [Herbie](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/herbie/)
- sick
- fever
- cold
- cough
- programming assignment
- tests
- experiments
- Giant hypermarkets
- Merdeka party
- [PTPTN](http://www.ptptn.gov.my/) loan registration
- USB applications

Like what my programming lecturer said, just follow the [KISS principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)!

**Update 30 August 2005**: And not forgetting, **Happy Merdeka Day to all**.
