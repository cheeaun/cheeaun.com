Belated Happy Chinese New Year
===

Alright, I'm back from my hometown yesterday. The traffic was terrible and it took **8 hours** to reach KL from Penang! A huge headache!

Well, I [went back last week](http://twitter.com/cheeaun/statuses/674345452 "will be back hometown later.") with my friend in a car. Since there are no Internet connection in my hometown, I got not choice but to use [Opera Mini](http://www.operamini.com/) on my phone to update my [twitter](http://twitter.com/cheeaun) and sometimes check on [Facebook](http://m.facebook.com/). Also not forgetting to check my emails with [Gmail Mobile](http://www.google.com/mobile/mail/). Though I brought my laptop along, I didn't use it much for some reason. Few days without looking at the LCD screen seems pretty *healthy* for me. I had a look at the Firefox t-shirt which [I've won](http://www.intothefuzz.com/2008/01/11/and-the-winners-are/ "And the Winners Areâ€¦") and it is **really cool**. The logo [seems a little old](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/spot-the-difference "Spot the difference") because it lacks the glossy part, but anyway I'm very happy to have this shirt, for free.

Here, I wish every one a belated Happy Chinese New Year!
