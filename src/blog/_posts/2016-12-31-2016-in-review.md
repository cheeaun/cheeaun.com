2016 in review
===

I've been writing this review thing for quite a long while, and the past [two](/blog/2014/12/2014-in-review/) [years](/blog/2015/12/2015-in-review/) were pretty *epic* in my opinion. Now it's that time again to look back and see what happened and what I've done.

Tokyo
---

I didn't plan this trip initially but somehow I got a free ticket to the [LINE Developer Day](http://linedevday.linecorp.com/jp/2016/), so… why not?

On [September 23](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/779258921949106176), I departed from Singapore to Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND) with a stopover at Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK). By the time I reached there, it's already September 24 and the conference is held on September 29, so basically I only have 5 full days of doing *touristy* stuff.

This is my second time in Tokyo and honestly, it feels *really* good to be back. I know my way better now, including all the opening/closing times and station exists/entrances.

[![stairs at Atago Shrine in Tokyo](../images/photos/scenery/stairs-atago-shrine-tokyo.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKunXd5gr46/)

[![Giant Sky Wheel at Odaiba, Tokyo](../images/photos/scenery/giant-sky-wheel-odaiba-tokyo.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKxiCRngGui/)

This time, Tokyo [felt warm](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/779869648984477696) to me as I sweated every time I walk around the city. It rained on the first day and last day so I have to buy those transparent umbrellas from the convenience stores. 😅

I tried [matcha](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKuo5bpAz1l/), [unagi don](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKuwFV2A1Dm/), [sushi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKxBthaAyro/) and [Ichiran](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKvTKOsgLfD/) [ramen](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKxzy_LAhSR/) [again](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKx1iLpAjYG/). I saw not one but **two** Ferris wheels; one at [Odaiba](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKxiCRngGui/) and another one at [Kasai Rinkai Park](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKxiTPXggWN/). I tried the [ramen at the Michelin-starred Tsuta restaurant](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKzsSwcgzXc/). I tried [taking the bus](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK47go1A_6O/) instead of the usual trains.

I've also tried **two** exotic meals; [raw horse meat](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK0pM3QgSFp/) 🐴 and [whale sashimi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK2GB0Tgg13/) 🐳. Not forgeting the quite-hyped [melon pan](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK2e8-igHRB/), [okonomiyaki](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK8S1vyACq5/), the [7-shades-of-green](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK5S7UxgINb/) [Nanaya matcha ice cream](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK5TB9yAExb/) and the **must-try** oh-my-god-super-milky [Cremia](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK8Uf0QADO_/). 😋😋😋

Best year yet
---

Even though I had less travels this year, it's been my best year yet as I write more, give more talks, release more side projects, meet more people, got interviewed a few times, and got featured by other people and publications a few times.

2015 was the year when my life took an unexpected turn and 2016 *turned* it around again, in a surprisingly positive way. It's rather unexpected but I guess that's what makes life so interesting.

Looking forward to 2017. 🚀
