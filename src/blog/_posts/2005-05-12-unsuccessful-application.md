Unsuccessful application
===

I received a letter from [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/) today. It wrote:

> I regret to inform you that your application for admission to National University of Singapore (NUS) has not been successful.

> Admission to NUS is very competitive as a large number of talented students apply each year. Please be assured that your application was treated with utmost care and thoroughness before we arrive at this very difficult decision.

> We appreciate your interest in NUS and wish you all the best in your future endeavours.
