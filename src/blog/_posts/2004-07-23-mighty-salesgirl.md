Mighty salesgirl
===

I've just read [one of the most interesting article](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/7/23/nation/8502990 "Salesgirl lends her weight to fight crime") on newspaper. It's about a salesgirl named Wong Pei Fan who taught a thief some *very good* lessons, as quoted:

> The thief fought back but the gutsy Wong gave him a kick in the groin.
