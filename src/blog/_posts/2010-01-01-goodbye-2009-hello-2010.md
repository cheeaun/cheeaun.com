Goodbye 2009, Hello 2010
===

It's time for a *short* review of what I did for the past few months in the year 2009.

Let's do an unordered list here:

- Those who don't follow my [tweets](http://twitter.com/cheeaun) should know that I'm now living and working in Singapore. I moved out from Kuala Lumpur and [started working](http://twitter.com/cheeaun/statuses/3512638534) in Singapore by around August. Migrating was *quite* a tiring but fun exercise, especially to another country. I find it very convenient to travel around the places in Singapore with its good transportation system, more organized directions and online maps.

- Ever since then, I've been joining a number of events such as [GeekCamp Singapore](http://geekcamp.pbworks.com/), [Singapore Google Technology User Group](http://sg-gtug.org/) meetups, [WebSG meetup](http://websg.org/archives/2009/09/meetup-on-the-30th-of-septembe.php), [BarCamp Singapore 4](http://www.barcamp.org/BarCampSingapore4), and [Neoteny Singapore Camp 1](http://neotenylabs.com/nsc1/). I did a short [lightning talk](http://twitter.com/cheeaun/statuses/3471708289), a [presentation plus demo](http://www.slideshare.net/cheeaun/pentago-on-wave), another [awesome demo](http://twitter.com/pav_curious/status/6362813085), and a [5-minute talk](http://twitter.com/cerventus/status/6595954316). Wow. The good news is I get a lot of freebies from those events. Awesome.

- Last year, I had [3000 tweets](http://cheeaun.com/blog/2008/12/goodbye-2008-hello-2009 "Goodbye 2008, Hello 2009"). Now, it's a **whooping 12000 tweets!** That's a huge increase by 400%!

So, that's all. My new year resolution perhaps would be to update this blog as often as possible. Or better yet, tweet more often! Haha!

**Happy New Year 2010 to everyone**.
