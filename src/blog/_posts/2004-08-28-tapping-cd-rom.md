Tapping CD-ROM
===

Something is wrong with my CD-ROM. Suddenly, it cannot work for no particular reason. My 52x CD-ROM is actually quite *old*. From the Windows Device Manager, it's known as Targa 52X-A, whatever is it. When I put in an audio CD, Windows tells me that there's no disk in this drive. Somehow, I could actually hear some *tapping* sounds when the CD-ROM operates. After three taps, the CD-ROM stops working, as if it detects no CD in it. When I eject the CD, I notice that it *didn't even spin*. The CD cover is shown exactly at the same position as I've initially put it.

Now, this is **bad news**. How do I fix this?
