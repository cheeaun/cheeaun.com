Still alive and tumblelogging
===

Ya, I'm still alive. And my examination period has passed. Wow, I feel so free now.

Many things happened for the last few months, which include stuff like boring assignments and test papers. It was quite frustrating but it's okay now. Just waiting for the results to come out. Anyway, I've been pretty *quiet* here because I've started on something new called [tumblelog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog). It's something like a quick-and-dirty, mini-blog if you prefer to call it that way. The concept is good and is very suitable for busy people like me. Having a blog takes time and effort, while a tumblelog is just fast and easy. I'll be experimenting it for the next few months though.

So, try check out [my tumblelog](http://cheeaun.tumblr.com/ "cheeauntumb") now!
