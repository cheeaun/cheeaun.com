I [learnt](http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2005/Oct/16/because_lists_are_fun.html "Because lists are fun") [this](http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2005/Oct/17/another_bulletin.html "Another bullet-in") from Neil.

- Programming is fun, but I still prefer PHP more than C/C++.

- In my opinion, circuit design is interesting, practically but not theoretically.

- I went to the markets in the SS2 neighbourhood with my friends twice.

- The Penang food sold here is definitely **not** genuine Penang food.

- I also went to [Mid Valley](http://www.midvalley.com.my/) with my friends twice.

- I've  watched [Flightplan](http://flightplan.movies.go.com/) and [Transporter 2](http://www.transporter2movie.com/). Recommended movies indeed.

- I had a haircut. My hair is short now. Cool.

- By end of this month, I'll be taking my final examination. Wish me luck!
