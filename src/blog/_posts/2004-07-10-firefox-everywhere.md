Firefox everywhere
===

Okay, I've added [my own Firefox review](http://download.com/3302-2356_4-10299359.html?pn=12&fb=1) and downloaded the Firefox 0.9.2 torrent file from [pryan.org Mozilla Bittorrent tracker](http://pryan.org/mozilla/bt-tracker/) using [Yet Another Bittorrent Client 2.6.8](http://pingpong-abc.sourceforge.net/ "ABC - Yet Another Bittorrent Client"). By the way, I found out that [Gmail Notifier Extension v0.2](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/doron/archives/005936.html) was released and doron, the author of the extension, quoted:

> Using the gmail notifier is against your Gmail agreement, and I won't be held responsible for anyone losing his/her account or becoming the top result for *agreement breaking bastard* on google.
>
> â€” <http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/doron/archives/005936.html>

I wonder, should I use this extension then?

Focusing on Firefox, there's a [new site in town](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=96527 "Mozilla Firefox Switch Site") called [Firefox Switch](http://fcdnet.org/switch/). It's pretty neat and clean from the look, but just a *little non-semantical* in the markup, in my opinion. At least, I [didn't forget](http://hao2lian.blogspot.com/2004/07/its-quite-sad.html "It's Quite Sad") hao2lian's [why firefox](http://earth.prohosting.com/hao2lian/firefoxwhy/) site. I hope he's not too sad.
