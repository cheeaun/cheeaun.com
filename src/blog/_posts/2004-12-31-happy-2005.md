Happy 2005
===

It's new year's eve. I supposed the whole Malaysia is [not celebrating](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/12/31/nation/9785180 "City Hall cancels New Year party permits"). It's because we have learnt a new word. [Tsunami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami). Searching the web, I found a lot of tsunami-related stuff, such as Jeff Ooi's [blog](http://jeffooi.com/ "Screenshots..."), [other Malaysian blogs](http://petalingstreet.org/ "Project Petaling Street"), [photo gallery](http://202.186.86.35/photos/gallerylist.asp?pixfder=419), [movies](http://archive.org/movies/movieslisting-browse.php?collection=opensource_movies&cat=tsunami "open source tsunami movies"), [torrent files](http://jlgolson.blogspot.com/2004/12/tsunami-video.html "Tsunami Video"), [bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/tag/tsunami "del.icio.us/tag/tsunami"), [more photos](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/tsunami/ "photos tagged with 'tsunami'") and [even more photos](http://lightning.fotopic.net/c378984.html "Disaster at Penang (Tsunami)"). I felt so lucky that I'm still alive. At the same time, I felt very sad for those unlucky ones. I wish a happy new year to all victims of the earthquake and tsunami tragedy. God bless you all.
