Motivational lecture
===

Today in school, all form 5 and upper 6 students, including myself, attended a lecture on study motivation. The lecturer is Dr. Shukri Abdullah, a guy wearing the 80's spectacles, with beard and moustache on his face. His lecture is quite *motivational*, accompanied with LCD projection of *motivational* presentational slides, probably made with Microsoft Powerpoint 2003. He even include bits of videoclips into his presentation files, plus few shots from movies such as [The Matrix](http://thematrix.com/) and [Lord of the Rings](http://lordoftherings.net/). It was fun. He tries to extract positive values from the movies. For example, a scene from The Matrix where Morpheus tells Neo to free his mind before jumping from one skyscraper to another. The lecturer told us to *free our mind* when facing examinations. It sounds ridiculous but pretty cool. Some of my friends actually suspect the videos embedded into the Powerpoint files are *pirated*. From my observation, Dr. Shukri might have rip movies from CDs or DVDs and edit them using Windows Movie Maker or something. So I wonder, isn't that copyright violation?
