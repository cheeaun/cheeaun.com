Just a little bit hard
===

Today, I did my Digital Systems Design paper. As I wrote last week, this subject's assignment is very, very hard. But the examination paper is surprisingly easy. Easy but some questions are a little bit hard though.

However, this is not what I'm worried about. Next week, I will be facing my worse nightmare. **Three examination papers** consecutively in three days. That is unbearable indeed. Now I'm just wondering if I can take this challenge. Sigh.
