Malaysian Firefox fans
===

After days of searching, I'm quite disappointed to find only *a few* Malaysian Firefox fans:

- Ching Yonghan of [Jsxblog](http://jsxblog.uni.cc/)
- Kenny Lee Jian Siong of [Beyond Thoughts Dreams](http://kljs.blogspot.com/)
- Hafiz Ismail of [foreclosure of a dream](http://hafizismail.com/)
- fundabonka of [Darker Side Of Saturn](http://darker-saturn.blogspot.com/)

I'm not sure if there are *more*, but I will keep on finding. I supposed no one has [added a party suggestion](http://openforce.at/mozparty2/ "mozparty2") in Malaysia, yet?
