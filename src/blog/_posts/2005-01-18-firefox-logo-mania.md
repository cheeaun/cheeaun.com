Firefox logo mania
===

![two Firefox logos, one is original and the other is recreated from scratch](/blog/images/artwork/icons/original_recreated_firefox_logo.png)

I think I did this two months ago but I couldn't remember. Anyway, I won't keep it on my hard drive for long. My hands got itchy at that time, so some of you might expect what will happen. Yes, I've played around with the Firefox logo. I challenged myself to recreate the *whole* logo in vector form. It took me more than one day to complete and looks *almost* identical to the original artwork, but the shading, gradients and shadows are *slightly* different though, if you have trained eyes.

Once it's done, I start to play with my creativity.

That's all folks. Not as pretty as the original masterpiece, but well, I've tried my best at least.
