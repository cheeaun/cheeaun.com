Cousin's wedding
===

Last two days, I was in Sitiawan and Lumut, to attend my cousin's wedding dinner. It was [a great day](http://chzehong.blogspot.com/2005/07/mr-and-mrs-hayhurst.html "Mr. and Mrs. Hayhurst") for my cousin, Poh Jin Lian and her beloved, Matthew Hayhurst. Congratulations to both of them. I also met with my other few cousins and relatives, as most of us stayed at the Sherwood Marina Cove Resort. On Saturday night, after the dinner, we played a game called *Taboo*, sounds weird and definitely not suitable for those with minimal knowledge of the English vocabulary. Even Matthew, the bridegroom, joined us to have fun! Haha.

At the same time, I'm also very aware that most of [my friends](http://getrichwithme.blogspot.com/2005/06/varsity.html "Varsity") have [left for their local universities](http://spaces.msn.com/members/angelinemiss/Blog/cns!1p4Yw4iJpFclUrAHYLVdrMyQ!512.entry "oFf 2mL..."). Good luck and hope you all have a *great* time there.
