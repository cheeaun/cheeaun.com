Maths Paper 2 and Chemistry Paper 1
===

The questions in the mathematics paper are quite tricky. I had problems solving some of the questions on vectors and probability distributions. Later, the Chemistry objective paper is *quite okay*, because I just simply choose one of 4 answers provided. During the examination, I felt *a slight pain on my bottom*. Maybe I have been sitting on non-cushioned chairs for too long. Also maybe sitting in front of my computer for too long. Sigh.
