Goodbye 2008, Hello 2009
===

2008 has been **a great year**, at least, for me.

It's the year when I revived Phoenity. It's the year when I finally graduated from university. It's also the year when I started working full-time and have the *extra* time to keep up with all sorts of projects and stuff. Things change. Ya, a lot of things.

To my surprise, I realised that I've only blogged **4 times** in the year 2008, excluding this one. The irony is, I've probably posted up to **3000 tweets** on [my Twitter](http://twitter.com/cheeaun) and **680 posts** on [my tumblelog](http://cheeaun.tumblr.com/), this year, if I'm not mistaken. How interesting is that?

Anyway, time flies. It's time say bye to [2008](http://fuckyou2008.com/ "Fuck You, 2008!") and hello to the new year 2009. **Happy 2009 to everyone!**
