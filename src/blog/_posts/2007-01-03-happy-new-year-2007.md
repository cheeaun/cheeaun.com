Happy New Year 2007
===

Wow, what a blast. Past few days have been really fun, with all the celebration since Christmas till New Year. I've been celebrating with my friends, going here and there such as Sungei Wang Plaza, BB Plaza, Berjaya Times Square, and staying over at friends house in Rawang and Nilai. First time celebrating both events in Kuala Lumpur can be so much fun and crazy at the same time. Haha!

Gosh, I'm so tired now. And ya, Liew, [thanks a lot](http://liewcf.com/blog/archives/2007/01/death-note-the-online-version/ "Death Note, the Online Version"). I will personally blog about it soon.
