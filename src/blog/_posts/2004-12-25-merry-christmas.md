Merry Christmas
===

**Merry Christmas** to everyone!

I didn't celebrate it much, but well, I'm busy with some stuff, especially the Phoenity theme for Thunderbird. I'm not very sure when it will be done, maybe by New Year's eve? So, I think I'll steal [an idea](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/007158.html "Merry Christmas") from David Tenser and offer *six Gmail invites* as Christmas gifts for everyone who reads my blog. Just e-mail me to get them. Cheers.
