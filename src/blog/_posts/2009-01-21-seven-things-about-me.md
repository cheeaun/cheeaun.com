Seven things about me
===

Okay, I [got tagged](http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2009/01/19/seven-things-about-gen/ "seven things about gen") by Gen Kanai. It's been a long time I haven't been tagged, so things will be a little rusty, especially the fact that I don't blog often now.

First, the *golden* rules:

- Link to [your original tagger](http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2009/01/19/seven-things-about-gen/ "seven things about gen") and list these rules in your post.
- Share seven facts about yourself in the post.
- Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.
- Let them know theyâ€™ve been tagged.

The fourth rule is not mentioned on Gen's post, but I manage to check my [site statistics](http://haveamint.com/ "Mint") that some referrers came from [Planet Mozilla](http://planet.mozilla.org/). Few hours later, Gen notified me via email. Cool.

Well then, let's begin.

1. Probably I mentioned this before on [my old 'About' page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119085313/http://cheeaun.phoenity.com/about/). I got my first computer when I was 15, on November 2000. So, I never had the chance to try Windows 95, at all, except on my cousin's computer last time. My first operating system is Windows 98, not Windows 3.1. But I did try that old operating system on a [virtual machine](http://virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox") and was uh, not really excited about it. Haha.

2. I never had an ambition when I was small. In fact, I always say 'I don't know' whenever my dad asked 'What is your ambition?'. Little did I know that now I'm a [web designer](http://alistapart.com/articles/understandingwebdesign "Understanding Web Design"). Or a *web developer*? Whatever.

3. I can draw! Of course, since I can *design*. I use to draw comics. Ya, **comics**. Japanese style. [Manga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga). I don't read many comics, but I draw my own instead. My own storyline as well. Cool, eh? Even though I can draw, I don't actually know how to paint. I hate [watercolour painting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolor_painting) a lot, because I always have a hard time getting the [RGB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB) that I want.

4. My [name is mentioned in one book](http://books.google.com/books?id=sfciobmzOOcC&pg=PA110&dq=chee+aun#PPA111,M1), which is the [Firefox Secrets](http://www.sitepoint.com/books/firefox1/) book by Chu Yeow. It's there because my Firefox theme is included with the book. However, I [was surprised](http://twitter.com/cheeaun/statuses/1019468656) that the keyword 'Phoenity' is [mentioned in **four** books](http://books.google.com/books?q=phoenity)! Wow.

5. I started learning to play [pool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_billiards "Pocket billiards") and watch Japanese animations during my university life. Skills and addiction. It was fun. No regrets.

6. My favourite place now is Singapore, probably because it's near my country. Also probably because I've never traveled to any other countries besides Singapore and Thailand. It'll probably the place where my next venture will be, too. So, **watch out**, Singaporeans. Hah!

7. I've made a web site that appears on television before. Period.

Done, and it's time to tag seven people!

- Jinny Wong of [djspinnet.org](http://djspinnet.org/), also regarded as [Miss Independent](http://fosschix.my/ "FOSSchix.my").
- Kamal Fariz of [bitfluent](http://blog.bitfluent.com/), a *passionate* [Ruby on Rails guy](http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/4207-kamal-fariz).
- Cheah Chu Yeow of [redemption in a blog](http://blog.codefront.net/), an anime-freak and developer.
- Danny Foo of [Websites Made Simple](http://www.dannyfoo.com/blog/), yet *another* web designer.
- Nazrul, also known as [Mr. Buyot](http://www.buyot.org/), uh, a *rollerblading geek?!*
- Ikhwan Nazri, also known as [Tekong](http://tekong.flavert.com/), the Flash guy.
- Perry Loh, also known as [skeevs](http://skeevs.com/), the [KTHXBAI](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kthxbai) dude.

Enjoy.
