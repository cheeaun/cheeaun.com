Experimenting things
===

It seems that I haven't post much these days. I want to post but simply don't have much time because I spend most of it *experimenting things*. Wondering what am I experimenting? Here they are:

- [Phoenity for Thunderbird 1.0](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=194446)
- [Firefox 1.1 Options on Firefox 1.0](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=197355)

Maybe I should organise my time?
