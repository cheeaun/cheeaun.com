Earthquake in Penang?
===

Few minutes ago, I was sleeping comfortably on my bed in my room. Suddenly, I felt that my bed was trembling as I heard noises outside my room's window. Those noises sound like people running. *A lot of people* running. At that time, I thought that I was having a dream. In my subconscious state, I also heard people calling others to run away from something. I'm not sure what *really* happened but I woke up immediately as my mom called me up and told me to get out from our apartment because neighbours told her that an earthquake is happening. What? **Earthquake**? In Malaysia?

Anyway, my mom and I got out of our house, seeing neighbours rushing to the stairs. We just followed, walked down the stairs and saw even *more* people at the lobby and several meters away from the apartment. Whoa. Some of them are still in their pyjamas as others flee with their cars right away. I heard they say that their things start to shiver vigorously as if a *real earthquake* is happening. As I look around, I was rather curious what actually happened just now. An earthquake in Malaysia sounds impossible though, in my opinion.

After standing outside the apartment for a while, all went up again as there are no trembling anymore. We used the lift this time. Everything went back to normal. Maybe the newspapers tomorrow will feature this phenomena.
