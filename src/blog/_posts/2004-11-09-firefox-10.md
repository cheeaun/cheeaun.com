Firefox 1.0

**[Mozilla Firefox 1.0 released!](http://mozillazine.org/articles/article5513.html)**

I am downloading it now, from a local mirror site I found from the [Lowyat.net forums](http://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopic=99673 "Firefox 1.0 is officially released!"). I browse around and found the news spread very fast. There's the [Firefox start page](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_11_09_index.html#110000468939863333 "Firefox Page on Google"), David's [hard work](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/006867.html "A Date to Remember"), Ben's [thoughtfulness](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/archives/006866.html "Firefox RTM - Take Back the Web") and Chu Yeow's [enthusiasm](http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/11/09/firefox-10-yes-10-is-out/ "Firefox 1.0. Yes, 1.0 is out!"). More can be found from [Google](http://google.com/search?q=firefox+1.0 "Google Search: firefox 1.0"), [Feedster](http://feedster.com/search.php?q=firefox "Feedster RSS Search: firefox") and [Technorati](http://technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?url=firefox "Technorati: Search for firefox"), just for your viewing pleasure.

Folks, **it's time to take back the web**.
