      <header><h1 itemprop="heading">Building side projects</h1><time datetime="2016-01-25" class="meta date" itemprop="datePublished">25 January 2016</time></header><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>On 3rd January 2016, I started my first side project of the year, despite having <a href="http://cheeaun.github.io/">few more side projects</a> up my sleeve. It&apos;s called <a href="https://railrouter.sg/">RailRouter SG</a>. It&apos;s a web app for people to explore MRT and LRT routes in Singapore. On <a href="https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/160380168739897344">20th January 2012</a>, I built <a href="https://busrouter.sg/">BusRouter SG</a> which is initially known as &apos;Singapore Bus Routes Explorer&apos;. It&apos;s a web app for people to explore bus stops and routes for all bus services in Singapore. Quite similar to RailRouter SG but for buses instead.</p><p>I&apos;ve built a lot of <em>things</em>. From small web applications to desktop applications. From small libraries to browser add-ons. From basic <em>demo</em> projects to web-based multiplayer games. Even then, I still find myself not <em>that great</em> compared to other people with more than hundreds of projects, like <a href="https://github.com/tj">TJ Holowaychuk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">Sindre Sorhus</a>.</p><p>So asking myself few questions. Why do I build it? What motivates me to build it? Is there a need for this kind of app? Do people request for this? Am I doing this for fame and fortune? Well, no. There&apos;s only one reason.</p><h2>Curiosity</h2><p>Some people call it an &apos;idea&apos;. I prefer to call it &apos;curiosity&apos;. Sayanee asked a question in my AMA, <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/ama/issues/7">How do you get your next idea to work on?</a> and my brief <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/ama/issues/7#issuecomment-119830311">answer</a> is:</p><blockquote>
<p>I usually don&apos;t find for ideas. For me, ideas come from being aware of things around you.</p>
</blockquote><p>And being aware leads to being curious:</p><blockquote>
<p>First is being aware of things around you, be curious about them, think about them, and things just naturally flow from that point.</p>
</blockquote><p>More than 10 years ago, I used to take buses all the time. At first, it&apos;s quite <em>exhilarating</em> because there were no apps or smart phones at that time. No Google Maps, no directions, no GPS. Every time I take a bus, I have to board the bus and ask the driver if the bus goes to destination X. And once I tried it few times, it slowly becomes a routine for me to take bus from point A to point B and vice versa. I have to memorise bus numbers and their routes. Whenever I look at bus stops, I&apos;ll observe every bus that stops there and note to myself, &quot;Ah okay, these buses stop here, I&apos;ll have to memorise them in case I need to come here one day.&quot; A question always pops into my mind, what if one day, I missed my stop? Where would I end up at? In fact, where does the bus end up anyway? I know that every bus has a route but I don&apos;t know how the route looks like.</p><p>That <em>curiosity</em> has stuck with me for a <em>long</em> time.</p><p>From my experience, there&apos;s a difference between <em>wanting</em> to build something and <em>starting</em> to build something. Curiosity is the <strong>first trigger</strong> to make me <em>feel</em> like I want to build something. Or perhaps in other words, I <em>need</em> to build something. It&apos;s quite similar to what people say that they have an idea and they want to <em>materialize</em> it into something more <em>solid</em>. So now that I have the curiosity to <em>ignite</em> my project, how do I <em>start</em>? <em>When</em> do I start?</p><h2>Spark</h2><p>Spark is the <strong>second trigger</strong>. For some people, this trigger happens in seconds <em>right after</em> the first trigger. For others, it happens in few weeks, months or even years. For me and BusRouter SG, it happened on 7th January 2012 when I read this tweet:</p><blockquote>
<p>if i could view bus routes on a map the way you can view subway routes on a map, i would take them a whole lot more.</p>
<p>&#x2014;<a href="https://twitter.com/mengwong/status/155511398653362177">@mengwong</a></p>
</blockquote><p>9 days later, I <a href="https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/158891916786794497">tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>If I&apos;m not mistaken, there are 318 bus services and 4617 bus stops in Singapore.</p>
</blockquote><p>4 days after that, I <a href="https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/160380168739897344">launched BusRouter SG to the public</a>.</p><p>Perhaps there&apos;s another term for this. It&apos;s kind of like a <em>magical moment</em> for me to start building it. It feels like <em>good timing</em> for me to start <em>now</em> rather than later. This kind of <em>spark</em> doesn&apos;t have to come from other people, places or any external <em>inspirations</em>. Sometimes it comes from within, for example when I&apos;m taking a shower, hiking up a hill, or talking to a friend.</p><p>Obviously, this is not all that magical. Things don&apos;t just suddenly happen in the timing between the first trigger and the second trigger. For years, I subconsciously kept my curiosity somewhere at the back of my mind, and constantly adding small bits and pieces of information to slowly <em>grow</em> the idea. I need to know where to get the data and which sites have it. I need to make sure there&apos;s a feature to detect my current location to instantly find nearby bus stops. I know that I can&apos;t draw <em>thousands</em> of bus stops and routes on the map because it&apos;ll be too overwhelming for the user, so I need to think of a better UI for this. I kind of draw <em>mockups</em> in my head and learn from how other apps present huge amount of data with a simple user interface. I probably need a better name for the app. I need to market it so that users would learn about it and use it, because I know there&apos;s no point launching an app that no one uses. I kind of want to display a realtime bus arrival information for every bus stop but the API was not perfect at that time, so I&apos;ll probably do that in the next phase.</p><p>Some people call this &apos;<strong>Product planning</strong>&apos;, as an ongoing process to define a product&apos;s feature set. And it has to be simple and feasible in terms of time and money spent for development. That&apos;s when the term &apos;<strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong>&apos; (MVP) came into the picture.</p><p>From my experience in building apps, I learnt this the hard way. In fact, I don&apos;t even have or know the term until I read some articles that mention them. And I&apos;m like, &quot;Oh, there&apos;s a term for this? Okay, cool.&quot; So how <em>minimum</em> does the product need to be? For my own side projects, I always try to estimate if I can finish it in a day. How about a week? Two weeks? A month? I usually avoid side projects that last more than a month because I always feel bored looking at the same thing over and over again. Basically maximum one month. Within a month, I have to launch it publicly. If somehow I&apos;m <em>unable</em> to publish it, I have to <em>at least</em> make it open-source and let the world see my code.</p><h2>Launch</h2><p>This is the ultimate <strong>third trigger</strong>. I call this a trigger because it&apos;s like a game-changer, well, depending on how you launch it. I&apos;ve seen some developers didn&apos;t even manage to cross this line because of <em>lame</em> reasons like the app is not perfect yet or the code is too ugly. I&apos;ve also seen some developers did a <em>soft-launch</em> for their side projects, which I think is pretty <em>lame</em> too. When I launch a product, I tweet it. I tell people. I try to blog about it. I post it on Hacker News. I want many, many people to look at my imperfect app or ugly code.</p><p>The moment when I launch a project, my senses are heightened. Suddenly I become aware of bugs that I didn&apos;t notice while coding. I start writing good READMEs so that developers understand what I did. I start writing good copy for non-technical users to understand what the product does. I check for grammatical errors, broken links and broken flows.</p><p>It&apos;s addictive. After the project is launched, I start to learn how to market it, experiment with advertising, play around with SEO, think about monetisation, and even pitch it to other people. It&apos;s surprisingly <strong>a lot of work</strong>.</p><p>Every single time when I do all these work, I start to understand the situation and difficulties behind all the <em>non-engineering</em> work. In a typical company, these are done by <em>other</em> departments; marketing, sales, advertising, social media, designers, bloggers and copywriters. There are times when I find it funny that I <em>could</em> understand what other (non-engineering) people do, but they don&apos;t understand what <em>I</em> do &#x1F625;</p><h2>Feedback</h2><p>When the project is public, I start to get many types of <strong>feedback</strong> from people. Positive feedback makes me happy. Negative feedback makes me try harder. <em>Unconstructive</em> feedback makes me learn how to ignore them. No feedback? Well... either try harder or be patient. It&apos;s <em>always</em> surprising when the project that you thought <em>no one</em> is going to care, <em>actually</em> cares. If there&apos;s still no feedback, just move on, start another project, go though the whole cycle again starting from the first trigger!</p><p>Sometimes I&apos;ll get one more type of feedback, which I think is <em>worse</em> than negative ones. It&apos;s the kind of feedback that makes me feel really bad and start to lose my love on the project, which ultimately lose my <strong>passion</strong> in building things. Obviously when we build stuff for the public, things don&apos;t always go your way. I&apos;m not sure how to describe this but it&apos;s kind of like a moment when I ask myself, &quot;Oh god, what have I done?&quot;. I&apos;ve had my bad moments. I&apos;ve done a lot of mistakes. I also know that some people have had it worse than me. One of them is Remy Sharp, who has the courage to even write a <a href="https://remysharp.com/2015/09/14/jsbin-toxic-part-1">5-part story on the <em>dark side</em> of JS Bin</a>, especially <a href="https://remysharp.com/2015/09/18/jsbin-toxic-part-5">part 5</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s like a test for mental strength. A test to see if I&apos;ll give up and quit. As what <em>most</em> people think, it&apos;s <em>just</em> a side project, right? How bad could it be? Well, you&apos;ll never know until you launch it.</p><h2>Maintenance</h2><p>I call this the <strong>maintenance</strong> phase, the period of time when I have to continuously handle user feedback, do customer support, fix bugs, add features and improve the project. It&apos;s a bit like an <em>endurance</em> test to see how long I can last maintaining everything and stay focused on them. At this stage, many things could happen. Some people end up <em>stop</em> maintaining and starting something else. Some people manage to monetize their own project and let it self-sustaining. Some people manage to turn a side project into a startup, for example, <a href="http://blog.natbat.net/post/61658401806/lanyrd-from-idea-to-exit-the-story-of-our">Lanyrd</a>.</p><p>This &apos;maintenance&apos; phase doesn&apos;t always work with the first trigger, curiosity, also known as the &apos;starter&apos; phase. It&apos;s very difficult to start something new while maintaining the old stuff. Vice versa, it&apos;s hard to dedicate the time on maintenance when you keep creating new things.</p><p><a href="http://jlongster.com/Starters-and-Maintainers">James Long mentioned</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>There are two roles for any project: starters and maintainers. People may play both roles in their lives, but for some reason I&#x2019;ve found that for a single project it&#x2019;s usually different people. Starters are good at taking a big step in a different direction, and maintainers are good at being dedicated to keeping the code alive.</p>
</blockquote><p>As for me, I try my best to play both roles. It&apos;s challenging. Sometimes I fail. Sometimes I got bored. Sometimes the projects I built became deprecated.</p><p>Few weeks ago, I got <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/mangafeeder/issues/1">a new GitHub issue</a> reported on an old project that I&apos;m no longer using. The project is called <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/mangafeeder">mangafeeder</a>, built in 2012, and never had any issues or pull requests until that very day. It was hosted on AppFog V1 which <a href="https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/afv1/migration-faq/">became retired</a> since December 15th last year, and I didn&apos;t even realise it. When I read the reported issue, I was very surprised that <em>someone</em> is actually using it. Despite the fact that I&apos;ve built a lot of things, this shouldn&apos;t be <em>that</em> surprising anymore but I can&apos;t help it. I tried to redeploy the app to the new AppFog V2, found it quite troublesome so I decided to deploy it to Heroku instead. The site is up and I resolved the issue with a reply.</p><p>The response I got is <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/mangafeeder/issues/1#issuecomment-168313991">this</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>awesome&#xA0;&#x1F44D;</p>
</blockquote><p>Somehow it reminded me of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FirarNC85sU">WWDC 2012 developer appreciation video</a>, especially the part where Emil Ovemar said:</p><blockquote>
<p>It&apos;s really fantastic to see what we have created has made a difference in people&apos;s lives. Those reactions worth way more than any downloads.</p>
</blockquote><p>From time to time, I always see people getting excited or obsessed over the numbers. Number of downloads, likes, loves, retweets, reposts, reshares, stars, followers, fans, visits, impressions and clicks. For me, those are just <em>nice-to-haves</em>. They are not really the most important thing in the world.</p><p>The <strong>number one reason</strong> why I don&apos;t give up and will continue building things is the positive response from other people. The <strong>thank you&apos;s</strong>. The &quot;Oh my god, you saved my life&quot; kind of feedback. Sometimes when I get 9 positive feedback and suddenly one negative feedback, it will make me feel bad for the rest of the day. I personally learnt that if one day, I get 9 negative feedbacks and one positive feedback, I should be happy instead, thinking that I helped at least one person.</p><h2>Beyond side projects</h2><figure><img src="/blog/images/figures/diagram/side-project-timeline.png" alt="Side project timeline" width="750" height="640" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Few days ago, on January 21st, I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153701648345189">gave a talk on this topic</a>, at the time of writing, to a group of students in <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/singapore">General Assembly Singapore</a>. I drew this simple diagram as a visual way to describe the <em>complete</em> &apos;side project timeline&apos;. It&apos;s a rough sketch of how I visualize it in my mind.</p><p>I mentioned that if you look at this timeline, it&apos;s a bit like a startup, but without the business strategy, hiring process, VC funding and money.</p><p>I took a third look at this and realise that it&apos;s a bit like <strong>life</strong> itself. &apos;Curiosity&apos; begins when you&apos;re born into this world. &apos;Spark&apos; probably begins when you start studying in school. &apos;Launch&apos; happens when you graduate. &apos;Maintenance&apos; is when you start working, buying a house, having a family and kids. Okay, pardon me, probably I got too far with this &#x1F605;</p><p>Nevertheless, it&apos;s a <strong>journey</strong>.</p><p>A journey that I wish that more people would be able to experience and tell the story.</p></div>
