I haven&apos;t touch the keyboard for <strong>6 days</strong>! What a suffering! Now, I&apos;m having a slight cold and headache, so here&apos;s a summary of what I did in the Lion City, all from my point of view, just <strong>straight to the point</strong>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Last time, in the MRT stations, I have to slide cards just like ATM machines, before the &apos;door&apos; opens. Now, no more sliding. Simply <em>smack</em> the card to a round-shaped sensor, it beeps and the &apos;door&apos; opens. Wow. And it even works in buses. I could witness some creative usage of this technology, for example, some people put their card in the wallet and <em>smack</em> it against the sensor, as the electromagnetic waves detect the chip of the card and confirms the transaction of money for the fares with a beep sound. Cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost all toilets in Singapore seems to be <em>standardised</em>. Standardised door knobs, standardised water taps and standardised auto-flushing technology (when you raise your bottom from the seat). Certain toilets in some shopping malls are decorated in such artistic way that I sometimes found myself lost. I thought I&apos;ve gone into an art gallery, whatever. Toilets rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All places in Singapore are filled with CCTVs. Most Singaporeans seem to get used with it, but somehow I couldn&apos;t. My sharp eyes always spot a camera on top of the ceiling whenever I turn my head. I could see so many posters in the MRT stations stating that <strong>about 40 CCTVs</strong> are installed, watching our every move. <em>Scary</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is one thing I like about Singapore is that where ever you go, there&apos;s always some walking space, beside the roads, complete with zebra crossings and cross-over bridges. If you get lost, you can look for the maps available at any bus stops or MRT stations. Very useful indeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car ownership is <em>hard</em> in Singapore. As I heard from a reliable source, you don&apos;t <em>buy</em> cars, but more like <em>rent</em> them. You have to pay these <em>renting</em> fees to the relevant authority for every 10 years. This might explain why I couldn&apos;t spot any &apos;P&apos; cars around, and I know in Singapore, these &apos;P&apos; cars uses a triangle symbol instead. Unlike in Penang, you see &apos;P&apos;s everywhere!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Penang, especially the island, most schools are situated near the major busy roads. In Singapore, I don&apos;t see any at all. Most schools are kind of located in the housing area, far away from major roads. The only schools I saw are St. Gabriel&apos;s school, St. Patrick&apos;s and Bedok South Secondary School. And I got to admit those schools look so much like architectural galleries, with noticeable usage of high-quality fabrics and decorative glasses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological University</a> is a very, very far place, but quite large. Much larger than <a href="http://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>, I think. I also try my luck applying for an undergraduate course there, on the very last day of the application closing date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lime colour seems to be the fashion trend there. I look around the shops, mostly display lime-coloured shirts, blouses, tops and <em>even</em> bras. I got so mesmerised by the colour that I even bought one lime-coloured T-shirt for myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some reasons, I like Tampines Mall more than the other shopping malls especially those along the Orchard Road, such as Takashimaya. The escalators and corridors there are <em>really</em> nice, if you know what I mean. Suntec City is also a nice place, but seems didn&apos;t change much since the last time I came.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a road in Singapore called Bras Basah Road. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t see any. Haha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also went for a hair cut in one of the barber shops in Tampines Mall. The hair stylist made my hair look like someone who has just woke up from bed. As an aside to my pale skin complexion and dark rings around my eyes, I <em>do</em> look sleepy. Somehow this hair style grabs few attention. Yucks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singaporean girls are beautiful, <em>generally</em> speaking. Okay, I don&apos;t mean to offend Malaysian girls here. Low-cut jeans is the popular choice among all the various female attires. Some younger girls tend to wear the squarely spectacles which make them look so geeky. Corporate women tends to be taller than guys and walk like models. Couples are seen everywhere too. Due to the presence of highly convenient public transportation, dating has become a much easier task to perform. Thanks to the <em>interconnectivity nature</em> of most Singaporean shopping malls, those couples would be enjoying a lot of time walking around and holding hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One night, I was looking out the room&apos;s window of my aunt&apos;s house and suddenly spotted a couple hugging and kissing each other in a van-like vehicle. It&apos;s my first time viewing such scene, though a bit blurry. Interesting, I thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&apos;t meet Chu Yeow. I know he once <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2005/01/13/the-ones-i-read-first-in-my-long-blogroll/" title="The ones I read first in my long blogroll">stated he might meet up with me when he come to Penang</a>. I don&apos;t have his contact, so I couldn&apos;t find him though. Sorry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I didn&apos;t meet Wendy Cheng, <a href="http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/" title="Why are you worshipping the ground I blog on?">one of the most popular bloggers</a> in Singapore. I know a lot of guys want to woo her, as her popularity <a href="http://google.com/search?q=xiaxue" title="Google Search: xiaxue">spreads so far</a>. I&apos;m not interested, okay?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>That&apos;s all, folks. I need some rest.</p></div>
