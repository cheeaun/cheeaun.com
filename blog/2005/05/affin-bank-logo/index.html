I might be <em>a bit</em> late, but I think it&apos;s worth a try.</p><p>Yesterday, I wanted to print my logo but as mentioned before, my printer is on <em>hiatus</em> due to weird ports problem. Feeling a bit nervous, I tried to think of solutions and phoned Huay Phing, who stays quite near my neighbourhood. She told me that her printer <em>works</em>. <strong>Yes!</strong> I transferred the files into a floppy before driving to her house. Upon reaching there, I immediately approach her computer and start doing my work. My sharp eyes spotted some installed software such as Mozilla Firefox, AVG antivirus and Quintessential Player. As I move the colourful animated cursor to open the A drive and double-click on the relevant files, I found out that the system responds quite slowly. Anyway, I manage to print my logo out of her <em>old</em> Canon BJC-210SP printer. Thanks to low-ink cartridges, the colours unexpectedly turn into brownish orange! Whoa. I tried various settings on the printer properties but to no avail. Sigh.</p><p>According to the contest&apos;s <a href="http://affinbank.com.my/bwb/tnc.html">terms and conditions</a>, all entries must be submitted <strong>before</strong> 19 May 2005. At that moment, Huay Phing asked me if my entry could reach Affin Bank in time, since late entries will be disqualified immediately. Hmm, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m late though. From my understanding, in whatever contests, the organisers set a dateline just to stop people from sending <em>more</em> entries after that and <strong>not</strong> to stop themselves from receiving entries, right? Or perhaps I&apos;ve missed some points here?</p><p>Well, things just got so ridiculous as Huay Phing helped me by asking for help from the <em>friends network</em>, such as Kah Peng, Chung Hwa, Yuen Munn and few whom I&apos;ve forgotten. All of them were either busy or not sure if their printers <em>still</em> work. Fortunately, Huay Phing found that Way Fern has a printer that <em>truly</em> works. With some mapping guidelines and without much hesitation, I went to Way Fern&apos;s house, uh I mean, shophouse. Her printer works great and my logo was printed in its full glory. I was very excited. On her computer, I found Mozilla Firefox too! Haha. Later, I chatted with her for a while before leaving.</p><figure><img src="/blog/images/artwork/logos/affin_bank_banking_without_barriers.png" alt="Affin Bank logo entry, with the motto &apos;Banking Without Barriers&apos;, for the Banking Without Barriers Logo Contest" width="400" height="150"></figure><p>I sent my entry on A4-sized paper with a 10&#xD7;13-inch envelope and a 50-cent stamp. On the paper, two versions of my logo are displayed, one of them is designed with Affin Bank&apos;s motto, &apos;Banking without Barriers&apos;. I&apos;ve also included a short explanation for my logo, written as such:</p><blockquote>
<p>This logo depicts the warm and friendly nature of timber <em>within</em> the whole word. The character &apos;n&apos; and &apos;b&apos; <em>connects</em> to each other, breaking through the dark-brown line barrier in between. All letters are upper-cased except the letters &apos;n&apos; and &apos;b&apos; as to strongly <em>emphasize</em> the true meaning of &apos;<strong>n</strong>o <strong>b</strong>arriers&apos;.</p>
</blockquote><p>Okay, I know, it looks <em>dull</em>. I realise that creating a logo for a bank is much harder than I thought and admittedly, I didn&apos;t put as much effort in this logo as the other logos I&apos;ve created. There might be some professional logo design companies and students from highly reputable art institutions taking part in this contest. Yet, this is the <em>only</em> entry from me, though the rules specify that contestants are allowed to submit multiple entries. Some people might submit more than 10 entries to simply try on their luck.</p><p>For some reasons, I feel that one entry is enough. So, the question now is do I stand a chance of winning this contest?</p></div>
