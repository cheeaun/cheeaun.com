I enjoyed it. Really.</p><p>Before the meet, I was kind of hesitant to go because I have a problem with transportation. At first, I asked my friend, Will Sen to give me a lift, but he seems not interested, eventhough he&apos;s a <a href="http://getrichwithme.blogspot.com/" title="Rich ME Rich YOU">blogger</a>, too. Then, I thought if I&apos;m going to attend this meet, I have to take buses and ferry, <em>to and fro</em>. So, I try to find for <em>alternative</em> solutions. I remember, Lucia wrote about <a href="http://jogalong.blogspot.com/2004/06/meet-meet.html" title="the meet. the meet?">her experience in last year&apos;s blogger meet</a>, when <strong>only one</strong> person attend. That guy was Jasdev, who went to the meet, all the way from mainland to Prangin Mall. Whoa. Immediately, I surfed to Jasdev&apos;s <a href="http://jasdevism.blog-city.com/" title="Jasdevism">weblog</a>, verified that he <em>is</em> a human being, found his mobile phone number, and contacted him. Fortunately, he responded and agreed to give me a ride on his motorbike. Yay.</p><p>The weather was hot. By the time we reached <a href="http://pelita.com.my/p_finder_usm.html">Nasi Kandar Pelita</a>, it&apos;s about 5pm. We try to look around and Jasdev found the bloggers group, maybe because he recognises Lucia. I was a bit surprised  and felt weird because <em>all are strangers</em> to me. I sat beside KS Tang, the guy who has <a href="http://kstang.blogspot.com/" title="A pathetic attempt at blogging">a pathetic attempt at blogging</a>. As I try to ask him who&apos;s who, he just answered that he had no idea at all. Haha. I looked around and recognised Peter Tan because he&apos;s on a wheelchair. I also recognised Lucia because she was <a href="http://jogalong.blogspot.com/2005/01/update-on-bloggers-meet.html" title="update on the bloggers meet">dressed in black pants and blue t-shirt</a>, <em>sort of</em>, if I&apos;m not mistaken. There were also two non-bloggers taking part, Joyce and Wuan.</p><p>Peter Tan looks different than what I expected. Frankly speaking, he looks very energetic despite his physical disability. He told me, he blogs <em>all the time</em>. Awesome. Jasdev is kind of a cool guy, who spreads his <em>Jasdevism</em> terminologies and wears the <em>Evil cap</em>, whether anyone notice it or not. His laptop rocks. <em>Really, really rocks</em>. I think he should be careful with his copy of Windows Media Player 10, though. Lucia always mention that she&apos;s short and fat, but actually, it&apos;s the <em>exact opposite</em>. <a href="http://jogalong.blogspot.com/2005/01/my-new-baby_25.html" title="my new &apos;baby&apos; ...">Her &apos;baby&apos;</a> is really neat, with all the shining metallic colours and amazing features. I always want to own one, but you know, money matters.</p><p>As I sat beside KS Tang, I found out that he works in the same area as I do, the Prai Industrial Area. He&apos;s from PenFibre and I&apos;m from GKN Driveline. What a coincidence. Besides, I also met Ong BK, the one who gave his Oops!! newspapers and calendar to everyone, <em>free of charge</em>. From his facial appearance, I could imagine he&apos;s some soft of a wise old man who lives on the Himalayas, where people strive to reach him just to ask the most important question of all, <strong>&apos;What is the purpose of life?&apos;</strong>. Okay, just kidding. As for Ee Yean, she seems quiet and maybe <a href="http://reallybites.net/mtt/archives/2005/01/sooo_penang_blo.html" title="sooo / penang bloggers meet">felt a bit weird</a>. Her name somehow reminds me of <em>1 yuan</em>, meaning China&apos;s 1 dollar. Haha. Sorry, Ee Yean.</p><p>The bloggers meet actually start at 4, but Jasdev and I arrived late. Lucia told me that HK Teh came before us, and took photos and videos all over before leaving. Kew also came and chatted for a while, also left in a flash. All of us bloggers, and non-bloggers, talked about various topics, as one by one left the group. At 9, we all left, with a hope that there will be yet another meet like this.</p><p>Ever since I decided to start blogging last June, this is my <em>first time</em> attending a bloggers meet. All thanks to Lucia for <a href="http://jogalong.blogspot.com/2005/01/bloggers-meet.html" title="bloggers meet">organising it</a>. As I mentioned, Peter Tan blogs <em>all the time</em>. Yes, he <a href="http://petertan.com/blog/archives/2005/01/penang_bloggers_2.html" title="Penang Bloggers Meet in Pictures">proves it, in pictures</a>. Ironically, I prove mine in words, instead.</p><p><strong>Update 2 February 2005</strong>: Okay, the <em>gang</em> has updated their blogs. Here they are:</p><ul>
