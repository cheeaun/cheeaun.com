Yes, I&apos;m going to sell my artwork. Yay. As you might observe, it&apos;s not that I&apos;m trying take a candy from a kid or whatever. I know, the <a href="http://malaysiabloggers.com/">Malaysia Bloggers forum</a> is a non-profit site. And I also know, Liew is <a href="http://malaysiabloggers.com/showpost.php?p=2743&amp;postcount=37" title="Comments about the Malaysia Bloggers Forum Logo designs.">never a rich guy</a>, pity him. It&apos;s just <strong>bad timing</strong>. If the forum were to be launched earlier, I wouldn&apos;t have made such <em>drastic</em> decision. No one to be blamed here.</p><p>Previously, I&apos;ve chatted with a student from <a href="http://mmu.edu.my/">Multimedia University</a> about the admission procedures and expenses. His name is Lim Cheng <del datetime="2005-04-14T20:34+08:00">Koon</del> <ins datetime="2005-04-14T20:34+08:00">Khoon</ins> and everyone, please give him a big applause because he could be the <strong>very first</strong> Malaysian Firefox <a href="http://showimage.mozdev.org/" title="Show Image extension">extension author</a>! He told me that the <a href="http://fcm.mmu.edu.my/">Faculty of Creative Multimedia</a> is said to be the busiest faculty of all and also spend the <strong>most</strong> money. That&apos;s when I start to realise that the course that I&apos;m most interested is one of the most expensive! He even pointed that the courses from <a href="http://limkokwing.edu.my/">Lim Kok Wing University College of Creative Technology</a> are <strong>much more</strong> expensive. I try the site&apos;s <a href="http://limkokwing.edu.my/forms/frm_enquiry.asp">online enquiry</a> just to ask if this is true. Well, a nice guy named David Teh replied and answered my questions thoroughly. 1 year of <a href="http://limkokwing.edu.my/lite/academic/ArtDesign/bod_GD.asp">BA (Hons) in Professional Design</a> costs RM 17,000 and 1 year of <a href="http://limkokwing.edu.my/lite/academic/ArtDesign/ba_GD.asp">BA in Graphic Design</a> costs a whooping RM 22,000! He also mentioned that I can apply for the <a href="http://ptptn.gov.my/">PTPTN loan</a>, however it only covers a <em>maximum of RM 8,000 per year</em>. Sigh.</p><p>Art equals to money, I supposed. As web design is also my passion, I found out that <strong>all</strong> local university web sites contain invalid markup. Besides the above mentioned, there are <a href="http://utar.edu.my/">Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman</a>, <a href="http://utn.edu.my/">Universiti Tenaga Nasional</a>, <a href="http://usm.my/">Universiti Sains Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://upm.edu.my/">Universiti Putra Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://uum.edu.my/">Universiti Utara Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://um.edu.my/">Universiti Malaya</a>, <a href="http://utm.my/">Universiti Teknologi Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://ukm.my/">Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia</a> and <strong>more</strong>. In my opinion, they should be <strong>ashamed</strong> of themselves! The one and only site I&apos;ve visited which contains not only (almost) valid markup, yet also follows web accessibility guidelines is <a href="http://monash.edu.my/">Monash University Malaysia</a>. Kudos to the webmaster. Unfortunately, the expenses for Monash University is very high. I think Jinny can help me verify this fact.</p><p>I&apos;ve been asking myself, should the development of a child be limited by money? I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m gifted or talented in some ways. I simply want to express my creativity,  that&apos;s all. Last Thursday, I&apos;ve met Benjamin Leow, ate something at the char koey teow stall and had a talk. He&apos;s the guy behind the <a href="http://surf7.net/">Surf7 network</a> and was a former Form 6 student of SMK Dato&apos; Onn, so we have much things in common. He opened up my mind about the potential of selling my artwork, especially logo designs. It&apos;s a good business. I begin to consider his offer to help me in this business, on how to earn money from my creativity.</p><figure><img src="/blog/images/artwork/logos/lcf_cf_combined_l_shifted_curved.png" alt="letters &apos;LcF&apos;, lowercased &apos;f&apos;, combined c&apos; and &apos;f&apos;, and shifted, curved &apos;L&apos; forming from simple characters to a figure" width="80" height="220"></figure><p>This is when the bad timing comes. I&apos;m going to sell the Malaysia Bloggers logo and Liew <a href="http://malaysiabloggers.com/showpost.php?p=2730&amp;postcount=35">won&apos;t pay for it</a> if there are no sponsors, donators or advertisers. Somehow, the more I read the threads in the <a href="http://malaysiabloggers.com/" title="Malaysia Bloggers forum">forum</a>, the more I notice Liew&apos;s nickname, abbreviated as &apos;LcF&apos;. My brain starts to generate ideas for no particular reason and my hands get itchy. I call this the <em>Uncontrollable Creativity Syndrome</em> (UCS).</p><p>I start with &apos;LcF&apos;, rendered with Lucida Grande. Really, I like the Lucida font family very much. Initially, the letters &apos;L&apos; and &apos;F&apos; are uppercased, &apos;c&apos; is lowercased, as how Liew always present it. Looking at it for few minutes, I discover some <em>connection</em> between &apos;c&apos; and &apos;F&apos;, when I try to lowercase the latter. A bit of editing connects both characters, with a sense of sleek curves. I also edit the character &apos;L&apos; to be more curvaceous and shifts it to a better position, under the &apos;cf&apos; figure. The lower end of &apos;L&apos; is lengthened for few pixels, to make the lines more consistent. The soft edges of the lines are sharpened to give it a <em>cutting edge</em> appearance.</p><figure><img src="/blog/images/artwork/logos/lcf_moulded_3d.png" alt="two figures, one is the flat &apos;Lcf&apos;, the other is the moulded &apos;Lcf&apos; with slightly altered perspective grid" width="290" height="140"></figure><p>I was thinking to take a much simpler approach in designing logos. Most logos I&apos;ve created are too complex, using a lot of colours and graphic effects. You see, most professional logos are simplistic, such as the <a href="http://actsofvolition.com/archives/2002/october/hidinginthe/" title="Hiding in the FedEx logo">Fedex logo</a>. Of course, I am <strong>not</strong> a professional so this is trivial anyway.</p><p>The flat look of the logo seems a bit weird. So, I try to <em>mould</em> the logo, altering its perspective grid, adding a dimension to it.  The logo looks elegant and a bit <em>modern</em>. It&apos;s like I&apos;ve seen it somewhere before, but not sure what is it. As simple as it gets, this logo is done.</p><figure><img src="/blog/images/artwork/logos/lcf_six_variations.png" alt="six variations of the &apos;Lcf&apos; logo, different colours and decorations" width="400" height="260"></figure><p>Regarding the design, I found out that the advantage of creating such simplistic logo is you can create many variations of it, depends on how good your creativity is. I played with mine and came out with six variations. Not <em>more</em> than six because the symptoms of my <em>syndrome</em> have stopped, finally.</p><p>Oh no, I&apos;ve <em>accidentally</em> created logos for <a href="http://liewcf.com/">LiewCF.com</a>. Should I sell them or should I not? Even if Liew won&apos;t be buying them, anyone with identical initials could buy them, though. Ironically, my name is abbreviated as &apos;LCA&apos;, only differ by one character. If not, I would have use it for my site. Haha.</p><p>Here I realised that my mind is confused. Too many things run around my grey cells. I hope anyone reading this wouldn&apos;t feel as confused as I do. Please pardon me.</p></div>
